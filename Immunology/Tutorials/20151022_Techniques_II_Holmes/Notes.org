* Transgenic animals
- Inserted transgenes
- Knockouts :: germline, tissue specific, inducible
- Knockins :: reporters, fate-map
- inject new DNA directly into single cell oocyte to inject gene
- 2000x expression - miRNAs sucked into motif, impacts other regulatory functions in cell, etc
- Protein level and mRNA level not tightly coupled!
- Egg vs emmbryo - much higher homologous recombination
- End up with chimera, coat colour marking
- Knockouts - cant assume mutation made only affects gene you targetted
- Action at a distance enhancers
- Delete gene, substitute something can select for - drug resistance for example
- Can knock on to other genes around
- Knocked down CD3 effectively, when trying to knock out CD3\epsilon
- Didnt release there was another transcript, effect seen due to other gene
- Tissue-specific and inducible knockouts/transgenes
- Can modulate expression of gene of interest when want to do so
- Tet-on, tet-off, feed mice with water with doxycycline
- Used when germline knockout might for example kill all T cells

* Cre-LoxP
- Fate mapping - identify cells derived from cells expressing IL17 at some point
- Do they stay secretors or go become other sorts of cells?
- (promotor)---(stuff, eg ROSA26, does not do much)---IRES---LoxP--STOP-STOP---LoxP---FluorescentProtein---
- LoxP cut out stop genes only when needed, then FP expressed in that lineage forever
- IL17A-CRE cuts out stop alleles
- CRE-ER (estrogen receptor) - produces protein but kept in cytoplasm by receptor until binds tamoxifen, then moves into nucleus

- CFSE - green dye permeating into cell
- binds to proteins and modified with fluorescence tag
- Fluorescent only in cell
- Cell divides and half of green proteins sent to daughter cells
- Pictures of no of cell divisions

- Cant just label peptideMHC-complex
- T cell receptors only bind transiently
- Must multimerise them - tetramerise with streptavidin
- Biotinylate protein
- Take advantage of avidity of multimer
- Tetramers can activate receptors - so be careful!
- Can use it to identify cells, but not necessarily to sort and use cells afterwards...

- Cytokines - measure using ELISA
- Can quantify number of cells making a cytokine
- IFN\gamma release assay
- CD45 >-- --< cytokine >-- fluorescence Ab
- Finds cells secreting cytokine
- Cell plasticity - does one thing now, may not do same thing later
- MO5 - melanoma tumour modified to express chicken ova peptide
- immunise with DCs pulsed with ova peptides
