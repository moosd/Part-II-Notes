* TIR domains
 - TIR dimers act as scaffold
 - MyDD88 (death domain----intermediate region (crucial for function)---- tir domain)
 - MAL (TIR---PIP2 binding domain)
 - TIR domain
 - BB loop is key functional part. BB = alpha helix B + beta sheet B
 - Proline - glycine - can mutate and disrupt signalling
 - Proline mutated to histidine to show TLR4 responds to LPS
 - TLR3 - alanine instead of proline used to recruit TRIF signalling instead of MyDD88
 - Symmetric TLR - inactive, asymmetric - active

* Death domains
 - After TIR:TIR interactions, DD:DD interactions with DD, Death Effector DOmains, CARD domains, Pyrin domains
 - Myddosome forms
 - TLR4 at top
 - MYDD88 -- MAL
 - IRAK4
 - IRAK1/2/M
 - IRAK-M is a negative regulator

* Interaction interfaces
 - Type I, II, III - each different parts of the death domain fold, no overlap - hence, same protein can be involved in three at once!
 - Scaffolding potential for macromolecular signalling complexes
 - FOrm symmetrical interactions
 - Myddosome - helical arrangement
 - helical structures can form from any DD protein overexpressed

* NLRs
 - Effector ----- NACHT ----- LRR
 - NACHT mediates oligomerisation and signalling complexes and nucleotide binding - e.g. ATP, also GTP/CTP. Crucial for activating receptor
 - Autoinhibited - LRR inhibits NACHT folding back on itself
 - ATP loosens autoinhibition, allowing recognition of ligand
 - ATP hydrolysed afterwards, closing NLR back up again
 - Hence, an opening and closing sensing process

* Effectors
 - NLRC (C for CARD) - leads to NFkB
 - NLRP (P for Pyrin) - inflammasome
 - Humans ~22 NLRs
 - Mice  ~35 NLRs
 - Zebrafish/sea urchins ~200 NLRs
 - NLRC4/NAIP
 - NLRC5 - antiviral, also transcriptional controol of MHC I (may be cell type dependant!)
 - CIITA - MHC II
 - NLRP7,8,2 - developmental, mutations lead to hydratid moles during pregnancy and loss of fetus
 - Target NLRs in disease - no immunosuppressive effects like when targetting IL1/TNF

* NOD1/NOD2 signalling
 - Cytosolic receptors, but ligands are extracellular!
 - 5/6 pathways of stuff getting into the cell
 - Peptide transporters
 - GRam -ve bacteria - outer membrane vesicles bleb off eith fragments, fuse with cell membrane
 - Autophagy in phagosome
 - Endosomal migration
 - Direct injection by bacteria, e.g. type IV secretion systems
 - Not membrane bound proteins, but they associate with membrane bound proteins as part of signalling complexes! (ko membanr bound proteins, ko signalling activity)
 - Active signalling at membranes - erbin1 negative regulator, FRMP2 promotes signalling
 - NOD2 - Paneth cells, secretes antimicrobial peptides
 - NLRP6 = intestinal response to viruses
 - NLRP1,3, NLRC4 -> inflammasome (ASC speck) -> oligomerisation of receptor
 - NLRP1b has definitive ligand (Anthrax lethal toxin)
 - NALP - ligand recognition
 - NLRC4 - drives inflammasome formation
 - NLRP3 - detects cellular pertubation? ALl ligands alter homeostatic balance in cell, most changes -> K+ efflux, hence activation of NLRP3? But not conclusive
 - NLRC4 -> cell death
 - NLRP3 - IL1B production
 - NOD2 - surface plasma resonance, LRR bound muramyl dipeptide, but still unclear
 - poly(I:C) mimics dsRNA
 - (mouse) NAIP2,5 - flagellin
 - (mouse) NAIL1,6 - type III secretion systems
 - humans - single NAIP with functionality of all murine ones
 - 2 signals for NLRP3
   + NFkb -> increase IL1B, increase NLRP3-ubiquitinated
   + Deubiquitinating NLRP3 by whatever damages cell

* Inflammasome
 - Adaptor ASC - primary driver of inflammasome formation
 - Overexpress to form speck structures
 - Caspase 4,5 in humans, same as 11 in mouse
 - Can have multiple PRRs - Salmonella activates NLRP3,4, AIM, one structure, more than one protein
 - Doesnt disassemble - once formed, stays forever, only disappears when cell dies

* Looking at it
 - 1 NAIP, rest NLRC4
 - Filaments forming in cell - discs stack via CARD domains
 - ASC filaments recruit caspase 1 filaments
 - Pyroptosis - cleavage of gasdermin D -> death of cell
 - Non canonical = no massive inflammasome
 - LPS inside cell seen as more serious danger signal
 - Septic shock - classic PRR disease
 - Mutations in PRRs increase susceptibility to certain diseases
 - Cryopyrin related diseases -> NLRP3 -> releases inhibited conformation of NLRs?
