* Protein-protein interactions
- What is the pathway?

* Membrane proteins
- Associate with one another
- Not soluble in water based solution
- Hence, use detergents to form micelles
- Which one? Hydrophobic and hydrophilic tails may disrupt structure/partners
- Try out lots of different detergents to see if it makes a difference to precipitation pattern

- Co-immunoprecipitaion :: What other proteins does it bind with?
- Micelles :: detergents can break protein complexes when solubilising them!
- Radioactive labelling - S-35 methionine
- Cysteine and methionine only two amino acids with sulphur, methionine more common

- Sphephodex surface with Staph auerus protein A - binds IgG Fc
- Ab to TAP
- Centrifuge out at low speed

- Then, SDS-PAGE, autoradiograph
- TAP1 and TAP2 must form stable heterodimer before binding to MHC class I (+tapasin)
- (Ortmann et al, Nature, 2014)

* Cytoplasmic proteins
- Mash cells mechanically
- Centrifuge down membrane components
- Epitope tagged proteins
- Add Tag sequence - dont need Ab to protein, just to tag, but need to genetically modify it
- Immunoprecipitation with Ab
- Con :: What if it binds where protein partner also binds?
- Con :: Non specific interaction a problem in protein-protein pulldowns

- Multiple copies of Tag introduced, because mAbs to tag are weak in affinity 
- Not efficient precipitation with one copy of tag

- Lots of non specific bands

* How to find out what the proteins are?
- Digested proteins bands with trypsin, used TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY
- (Steen and Mann, 2004)
- Con :: Only detects ~25% of proteins
- Accurately measures m/z ratio

- Ratio of C12:C13 -> binomial distribution
- Difference in magnitude between peaks should be 1 Dalton
- 0.5Da means 2 charges on peptide
- 1/3Da = 3 charges, etc
- So multiply up to get true mass
- If a peak bigger than original mass, actually because charge is lower (eg 1+)

* Then, confirm by further co-IP
- Probe in Western blot
- do IP, do washing to remove non specific binding, protein binding partner washed off too!
- Low affinity interactions, use a cross linking agent (e.g. DSS [disuccinimidyl suberate])
- Links proteins close together in physical space together covalently
- Protein not labelled, IL2 labelled (Sharon et al, Science, 1996)

- To make protein crystals, must get high protein concs!

* Surface plasmon resonance
- Also called biocor
- Laser through prism, metal surface reflects it, detector
- Angle of minimum reflected intensity changes based on mass on top of metal (refractive index changed)
- Measures addition of mass, can do it in a flow system
- See video by GE Healthcare Life Sciences
- Pro :: works whatever colour of sample itself since light does not pass through sample
- Useful because receptor-ligand on cell surface is weak
- In real systems, individual molecule affinities do not need to be high
- Molecules close together, hence cell to cell contact area small, apparent conc high
- in 3D box, conc will be diffuse and low, so lab conditions dont favour these things to be seen
- Previous solution - Multimerise them - prevents measurement of true affinity
- Con :: need good negative control - significant signal from no binding
- Typical MHC peptide interaction only 7 secs (But the true situation, they react in a different way!)

- Con :: SPR only used when can purify one component (onto a surface)
- Impure sample in flow - wont know what is binding

* FRET
- Protein-protein interactions in LIVING cells
- Fluorescence resonance energy transfer
- Fluorescence out of acceptor is different than from donor
- Need overlap of excitation spectra of acceptor and donor
- Want to excite at wavelength of donor
- Measure at acceptor
- But, overlap - must correct for this
- Need high level of expression of partner
- Dynamic - can see if different ligands bind

* Measuring concentrations of proteins
** WESTERN BLOTS
- Con :: Not very reliable
- Con :: in enzyme linked chemiluminescence, linear range very small - cant quantify very well
- Dilute protein and measure absorbance
- Can change amount of protein a lot with very little change in signal
- Can tell there is more, but not there is 3x more
- Con :: Antibodies not always what they say they are...
- Be very careful about specificities of antibodies!

** Mass spec
- For relative concentrations
- Take advantage of stable isotopes (C13)
- Label amino acid precursors
- SILAC (stable isotope labelling of amino acids in culture)
