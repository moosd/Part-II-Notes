* Intro
    - Bigger picture
    - T independent responses
    - B cells required for the formation and maintenance of SLO (Secondary
      Lymphoid Organs)
        + T cells need B cells to mount optimal responses?
    - IRA B cells
    - B cells as regulator

* T independent
    - T dependent on protein antigens (presented on MHC)
    - But important to have responses to non-protein antigens
    - T dependent in follicles within lymph nodes/spleen - Follicular B cells
    - Specific B cell subset in marginal zone of spleen (CD21/CD35 heterodimer)
      recognises complement activation component
    - CD1d recognises lipids
    - Follicular B cells monoreactive
    - These ones are polyreactive, low affinity for more than one antigen,
      promiscuous
    - Another subset, B1 cells - best characterised in the mouse
    - May have different origin - yolk sac, and so long living
    - Occupy different anatomical region. Mice, peritoneal and pleural
      cavity, sites interfacing with environment in more direct way
    - B1 cells and marginal zone cells -> T independant responses
    - B1 into two subsets
        + B1a, B1b, based on CD5 expression
        + B1a :: produce natural antibody - antibodies that are present,
          without any evidence organism was exposed to that antigen
          previously, cross reactivity with commensals in gut
        + Natural antibodies not undergone somatic hypermutation
        + Can recognise self antigens important to dispose of (opsonisation)
        + One reference suggesting natural antibodies important preventing
          atherosclerosis, getting rid of ox-LDL
        + Lupus (SLE), thought that natural antibodies help to dispose of
          apoptotic cells, but if too much of this debris -> lupus

    - T independent :: occur in athymic mice
    - Can cross link multiple BCRs, if additional signals from
      PAMPs/cytokines, sufficient to drive B cells to even class switch
    - MZ B cells (Marginal zone) critical for T independent sinus
    - Blood flows through marginal zone, hence can look through immunological
      information going through blood
    - (Cerruti et al, 2013) Get significant help from other cells
      (Macrophages to pick up antigens, dendritic cells, some evidence
      neutrophils picking up antigens in periphery bring them to spleen)
    - Neutrophil B helpers - cytokines (eg IL-21)
    - Neonatal mice/humans have poorly developed marginal zones, and hence
      susceptibility to encapsulated organisms - Strep pneumoniae
    - Pneumovax - carbohydrate antigens - limited utility in neonates because
      little MZ B cells
    - New vaccine, protein antigens bolted to carbohydrates - T dependent
      response, hence much better response

* Antibody independent B cell functions
** B cells as APC
    - Took some mice, gave them anti-\mu antibody, cytotoxic to kill cells
    - Immunised mice with KLH
    - Looked at lymph nodes, did restimulation assay
    - Hence presence of B cells helps with T cell proliferation
    - Got rid of B cells, so lack of proliferation?
    - T cells in vitro, cocultured with other B cells
    - B cells withh mito C = B cells there but cant divide
    - Selected B cells based on IgG expression - much better capacity to
      stimulate T cell proliferation
    - Suggested B cells could be important APCs
    - Made mice lacking MHC class II expression - produces B cell that can do
      everything apart from present antigen
    - CD19 - B cell specific marker
    - Much lower number of total B cells, cant proliferate
    - Interestingly, T cell phenotype - (CD44Pos, CD62Lneg = activated T
      cells) - much lower
    - Back-crossed mice to inbred strain of lupus mice
    - Antibody (rituximab, antiCD20) efficacy in treating lupus
    - Mouse heart transplant model, block costim to allow graft to survive
    - Made mouse with B cells that cannot secrete antibody, severity of
      chronic rejection same as wildtype - antibodies less important here
    - Bone marrow chimera strategy, irradiate and give 50% bone marrow, 50%
      MHCII knockout bone marrow
    - Only thing that lacks class II now B cells
** SLO formation and maintenance of subcapsular sinus macrophages
    - B cells make important contributions to development and maintenance of
      SLOs and particularly cell division
    - SCID mice, lymph node and splenic architecture disrupted
    - SCID with wt splenocytes, normal structures reforming
    - Follicular dendritic cells. Transferring splenocytes, restore
      architecture
    - Cytokines (lymphotoxins) important in formation
    - LT\alpha required?
    - Splenocytes lacking LT\alpha dont form follicles
    - Put in mixtures - B cells are the important cells
    - LT\alpha deficient B cells with wt T cells - funny disorganised
      architecture
    - Hence B cell LT\alpha required for normal formation of structures
    - (Golovkina et al, 1999) Look at Peyers patches. Without B cells, dont
      form
      - Expt without B cells, reconstituted B cell production, show Peyers
        patches reform
    - Required for maintenance of number of cell types in lymph node
      (Moseman et al, 2012)
    - Subcapsular sinus macrophages (CD169+), mark out macrophages living in
      medulla (SIGN-R1)
    - B cells function independent of antibody required for this
    - Via production of LTalpha1\beta2
    - almost complete loss of CD169+ cells
    - LT\betaR results in failure to contain viruses within SCS and systemic
      spread of infection -> death
    - SCS maintain integrity of layer to prevent systemic spread from
      subcutaneous infection

** Promote innate immune responses
    - Lots of GM-CSF in sepsis
    - (Rauch et al, 2012)
    - Injected mice with LPS
    - Where is GM-CSF made? In spleen! Which type of cells? Expected
      myeloid/stromal cells, actually B cells!
    - Flow cytometry on whole of spleen, keep gating on markers for B cells
      and look at GM-CSF, it is in B cell population (IgM+) where it is made
    - Are producers B2 or B1 cells?
    - CD45.1+ mouse - unusual, can distinguish between recipient and donor
    - Splenic B cells not contributing much, peritoneal B1 cells do matter
    - Bone marrow chimera strategy, reconstitute with \muMT and GM-CSF
      deficient marrow
    - Survival a lot worse. GM-CSF production critical for survival
    - Sequal ligation and puncture - model of appendicitis, massive exposure
      to Gram negative bacteria

** Important regulators of immune responses
    - Expanded hugely in last 5 years
    - Thought of them as effectors of immune response (Abs or cytokines)
    - Whole other face as regulators
    - Know B cells in mice and humans to produce immunoregulatory cytokines
      IL-10 and TGF-\beta
    - Tregs make these!
    - Part of function to skew production of tregs?
    - Maybe principle producers are terminally differentiated cells - Pregs
      rather than Tregs!
    - IL-35 too
    - Rituximab, 85% acute T cell rejection! Not 15% like normal!
    - B cell deficient mice have worse autoimmune disease
    - Myelin + adjuvant = MS disease, B cells limit disease (in EAE model)
    - (Mauri et al, 2003) - collagen induced arthritis, transferred anti-CD40
      Ab B cells (hence activated). B cells transferred able to prevent
      arthritis, dependant on ability to produce IL-10
    - To date, no transcription factor specific to Il10 making B cells, seems
      that subset of all B populations
    - (Yoshizaki et al, 2012) - CD1d+ CD5+ B cells ameliorate EAE. Transfer
      CD5+- B cells, not the case. CD5+ (B1) cells important!
    - CD5+ lacking IL10 no good
    - CD5+ lacking MHCII no good - cognate interaction required!
    - CD40 also needed
    - But requires T cell signals - IL-21, implicating a cognate interaction
    - Human blood B cells and stimulate them (CPG and CD40L) make them
      produce IL-10
    - CD24 and CD38 = B cell on its way to becoming Follicular or Marginal
      zone
    - Look in patients with lupus and stimulate, IL10 made not as much
    - Regulatory B cells may be deficient!
    - Some patients are tolerant kidney patients - stopped immunosupression
      because silly or cancer, despite this do not reject allograft
    - Peripheral blood transcriptomics, look at differentiation profile
    - 24 of 30 genes are B cell genes, not Treg genes!
    - Stimulates ex-vivo, produce far more IL-10 and far higher proportion
      making IL-10
    - IL-35 also investigated, transfer wt B cells
    - IL-35 has two subunits, come together to form active cytokine
      May also be another regulatory cytokine
    - Regulatory B cells function via Granzyme B? Killing machinery! B cells
      could kill effector T cells directly???
    - Finally, regulatory B cells explosion, but also regulatory plasma
      cells? Induce IL10 in any infection to switch off response eventually.
    - In vivo expression, look in middle of response, found highest IL-10
      producers, seems plasma cells are
    - Hence proposed Pregs
    - Mouse models, transplant rejection, argue that staggered production of
      plasma cells. Giving second dose of rituximab, took out cells at that
      point?
* Summary points
    - In contrast to TCR, can clonally proliferate, can become dominant APC
