# Wu and Xu, 2003
Recessive genes beneficial to males but detrimental to females initially accumulate on X chromosome
Since females masked expression due to heterozygous
IR like structures to limit expression to males only

# Berletch et al, 2011
Xist on silenced chromosome
Tsix (antisense transcript) on active one

Escape loops out of silenced X

Four core genotype mouse model to study effects of genotype wo hormones
Mouse with Sry deleted from Y and put on an autosome mated with XX

XX x XY-Sry

Offspring:

- XX females
- XY- females
- XXSry males
- XY-Sry males

Escape genes play role in disease - e.g. Turners syndrome, genes that also have a Y copy apart from those to do with female phenotype or X inactivation itself
PAR gene SHOX shown for short stature phenotype (Clement-Jones et al, 2000)

Early lethality due to placntal failure, many placental genes much higher expression in XX than X0

CSF2RA implicated (for haematopoetic diff), sig lower expression (Urbach and Benvenisty, 2009)

X aneuploidy (Klinefelters XXY) causes neurological disruptions

# Y (Hughes and Rozen, 2012)

Considered genetic wasteland not just from degeneratin but also from failure of classical techs like pedigrees

Not even thought to have dominant testis determining gene until 1959, since could be X dosage effect (CE Ford, 1959) with XY Turners patient

Foster et al, 1998 - Jefferson fathered Sally Heming's (his slave)'s last child

5 Strata from repeated inversions, XAR - fused from X onto Y

b2/b4 deletion in AZFc 1/4000 men, end of human MSY, removal of all copies of gene family, e.g. DAZ
=> nahr mediated

isodicentric Y chromosomes - mosaicism and turners, or spermatogenesis failure

Y chromosome has 5 types of sequence - pseudoautosomal, heterochromatic, X transposed, X degenerate and ampliconic

- X degenerate - degenerated from X sequence
- X transposed - X to Y transposition 3-4Mya, contains only two genes

Human Y only one characterised with two PARs

Transmission distortion > 50% of offspring
