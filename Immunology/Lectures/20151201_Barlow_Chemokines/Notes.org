* Intro
    - Turning cytokine biology into human treatment
    - Allergic asthma no cure, steroid resistant, in trouble
    - Block IL-25/IL-33 or both, prevent allergic asthma? IL-25 inhibitor,
      read out airway contraction.
    - Antibodies to target receptors
    - Monoclonal - 1975 @ LMB, Kohler, GJF. and Milstein, C. - hybridomas
    - 1986, Winter, G. for humanising antibodies @ LMB
    - TNFalpha as first therapeutic antibody target
    - Really complex network! Immune system is in balance. Taking one brick
      away, gives good effects and bad effects - increase in TB infections -
      latent infection. Subclinical.
    - Trigger unknown - means everyone has a different trigger - cant use
      blanket stats to say x is the trigger!
    - Problem - taking spectrum of disease because biology not characterised,
      and so cannot be targetted easily
    - Lots of pidgeonholing/stereotyping not individual analysis
    - Proproetrary biology - bad! Treats one thing as a product not a tool.  Start over with tools?
    - Redundancy a problem, also multiple organ failure from cytokine storm.
      Overdramatic? Dumping huge amount of cytokines systemically.
    - Humans different from mice. Because of affinities and amounts needed?
      Rather than scrapping therapy altogether?
    - Spectrum of disease. Misleading term - stereotyping at its finest
      again...
    - Non allergic asthma - even cold air
    - Redundancy of chemokine network
    - Network - how much of a drug to treat?
