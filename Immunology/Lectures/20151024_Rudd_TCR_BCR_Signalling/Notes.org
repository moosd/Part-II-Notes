* Intro
 - Immunotherapy :: Chimeric Abs, lymphoma therapy, 80-90% response rates
 - p56lnk/ZAP-70 = kinases
   + Initiators of cascade

* Integrin adhesion mediates T cell migration
 - Main APC is the dendritic cell
 - OVA induced TCR stop signal for motility in lymph node slices

* Sequence of events - T cell w/ dendritic cell
 - Stochastic process
 - Chemokines attracting T cell by dendritic cell
 - Some ligation of TCRs by MHC
 - Ca2+ influx into cell
 - Stop signal and immobilisation
 - Activation of integrins, spreading of cell against dendritic cell
 - Clustering - intracellular signal, NFAT activation, IL2 made
 - Clustering for avidity

* Affinity stage, then avidity stage
 - Multiple binding to integrins
 - Integrin for adhesion, clusters, focal adhesion kinases - for dissociation
 - T cell needs to spend time with APC but not too much time
 - Self antigens -> tonic signalling
 - (Some leaking of central tolerance)
 - Mark Davis :: Lots of self antigen presented at low level
 - Just enough to keep cells primed to see foreign antigen
 - Too much antigen -> activation, too little activation -> no immunity

* SMAC
 - SupraMolecular Activation Cluster
 - Late event, clusters form early, move into central part then redistribute themselves
 - LFA -> ICAMs
 - Some people believe it is a form of endocytosis
 - Additive effect of further clustering in SMAC

* Immunological synapse
 - T cells interact with APCs
 - Initiated by chemokines
 - TCR and kinases form microtubules
 - Inside out signalling
 - TCR activates LFA
 - Expand and increase contact surface area with dendritic cells
 - Different cell types -> Different microclusters

 - Not all activated at same time - cFos
 - Abbas, Lichtman, Rober, 1999 (Book)

 - Signal 1 = TCR
 - Signal 2 = Co receptor
 - Signal 3 = Chemokines, e.g. IL2 binding to same cell secreting it

* Integrins
 - Play early roles
 - Very Late Antigen - VLA - late expressed integrin
 - Quite selective in determining where T cells go
 - VLA4 - directs T cells to nervous system and gut
 - Block to treat multiple sclerosis

* T cell receptors
 - NOT polymorphic
 - Polymorphic means variable between individuals
 - TCRs are variable between cells of same individual
 - Tails too short to signal - hence they associate with CD3 coreceptors and \zeta chain
 - they contain ITAMs which are used to signal downstream
 - CD3 and \zeta chains differ in no of ITAMs
 - CD3 has one ITAM each
 - \zeta chain has three ITAMs

* B cell receptors
 - Somewhat similar
 - Ig\alpha and Ig\beta -> ITAMs too

* Central issues
 - How they work relative to classical receptors e.g. PDGF
 - Clustering of receptors to antigen
 - Already clustered!

* Protein tyrosine phosphorylation
 - Tony Hunter
 - Most involve serine/threonine

* Protein domains
 - SH2/SH3 = protein glue
 - Tony Pawson

* CD4/8
 - Bind to Src-tyrosine kinase
 - p56lck - inhibitor of T cell activation
 - Ca mobilisation is protein phosphorylation dependant too
 - lymphoid specific
 - SH3 binds to proline residues
 - SH2 binds to phosphotyrosine residues
 - Coupled to kinase domain
 - Y-394 site = autophosphorylation site
 - Y-505 site = loops over and binds with structure to SH2 domain
   + Tight conformational constrainment, prevents constitutive activation
 - Src from rous sarcoma virus
 - Truncated form of this protein, no looping without Y-505, hence constant activation -> cancer
 - pp60*
 - mutation shown to be a cause of cancer

* Cascade
 - Cascade phosphorylates ITAMs
 - tandem tyrosine containing motifs#
 - separated tyrosine residues
 - ZAP-70 has two tandem SH2 domains
 - Binds to tandem tyrosines on ITAM motif
 - Unique way of recruiting important kinase
 - Phosphorylates kinase domain
 - ZAP70 in T cells, Syk in B cells
 - Myristilation - binding to plasma membrane
 - CSK -> phosphorylates site, keeps cells quiescent
 - CD45 is the phosphatase, dephosphorylates - unfolds kinase
 - Difficult to intervene between protein-protein interactions
 - Successful immunomodulatory drugs inhibit kinases/phosphatases

* Kinetic segregation model
 - CD45 abundant on cell surface membranes - 2-3% of cell surface proteins
 - Dominant factor? Preventing inappropriate activation?
 - To activate T cells, must make more space, move CD45s away
 - CD45s have huge, cigar shaped ectodomains that would block interactions between T cell and APC
 - Antigen presentation pushes CD45 away preventing CD45 inhibiting response

 - Problems with this model! How does CD45 activate and inhibit!
 - Y-294 autophosphorylation would also be dephosphorylated because phosphatases are non-specific
 - T cell receptor, releases tails for signalling from membrane to make them accessible upon activation

* Themes
** Cross linking/activation
 - Problem: TCR already an aggregate, how can it aggregate around antigen?
 - Counter: rearranged self?

** Ligand/conformational change
 - NCK associated with tails, antibody shows tails becoming available in cytoplasm upon activation

** Kinetic Segregation Model
 - Problem: Positive and negative effects
 - Ignores phosphatases like SHP1
 - SHP1 is a soluble phosphatase, nothing to push away when APC comes up
 - Overexpression leads to potent negative effects on T cell activation
 - Not everything depends upon CD45!

* Signal transduction
 - Design therapeutic approaches
 - SCID (Rudd. 2006)
 - CAR = chimeric antigen receptor therapy

* Autoimmunity
 - Sakaguchi - discovered Tregs
 - Collagen injected, arthritis develops (collagen induced arthritis)
 - Dangerous experiment, pricked self -> issues seeing in one eye
 - Potent way of inducing autoimmunity
 - Spontaneous development with single point mutation in ZAP-70

 - IL2 essential, would expect no immunity if knocked out. Actually, autoimmunity!
 - ZAP-70 depleted, thymic selection needed to eliminate self-reactive cells affected
 - Release of autoreactive t cells
 - sit there, cant be well activated but perhaps pushed into it by strong stimulus of tonic signalling from self antigen

* PTPN22
 - Phosphatase
 - Mutation gives diabetes
 - Also lots of other autoimmune conditions - Graves, Lupus, etc
 - Responsible for inactivating p56lck by dephosphorylating Tyr394
 - No individuals found with mutations in Lck/ZAP70 because too lethal
 - PTPN22 - nobody thought it did much, hence survivable, but leads to increased risk for certain diseases through this process
 - T Bechrens, 2011
 - Rhee and Veilette, 2012

* Adapters
 - LAT signalosome
 - Haematopoietic specific adaptor proteins
 - Molecular switches
 - Effectors downstream
 - Specific to T cells
 - Allow formation of complexes
