* IL-12
    - M tuberculosis
    - Mouse that no longer makes IL12 (p40 ko)
    - Required for initiation step
    - Enters Th1 cell stage

* IFN gamma
    - Dendritic cell still can influence differentiation
    - M tuberculosis, IFN gamma loss -> all mice die.

* CXCL10
    - Chemokines tell where T ccells need to go (also Interferon inducible
      protein 10, IP 10)

* IL-13
    - For extracellular parasites - S mansoni (bilharzia), hookworms, etc
    - Looked at IgE production
    - Far fewer eosinophils in IL13 knockout
    - Hence important in driving Th2 response

* CCL11
    - Important chemokine (eotaxin) in type 2 response
    - Mice no challenge, no eosinophils, wt with challenge, lots of
      eosinophils, ko -> far fewer eosinophils
    - What initiates a Th2 response?
    - Ragweed pollen, recognised by epithelial cells lining airways, maybe
      also by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages. directly interacts
      with pollen releases some factor that initiates Th2 -> Il4,5,13 ->
      response
    - 2001 and 2005, initiating factor probably two - IL-25, IL-33 (both
      cytokines)
    - When IL 25 or IL33 administered to mice, they both indce a type 2
      response
    - PAS stain - stains mucin

* Th1 and Th2 cells alone?
    - Koffman (1986) - Two types of response, Th1, Th2, adaptive response
    - Not true! Accepted theory: IL12 essential for diferentiation of Th1
      cells, using MS as model. Autoimmune mediated by Th1 response
    - Give protein to induce autoimmunity, MS results
    - Includes tip of tail to shoulders paralysis
    - Then they get better, intact immune response
    - p40-/- -> treated with agent inducing MS, animals were fine...
    - p35 -/- -> autoimmunity!
    - But both make up IL12 - if IL12 needed, knocking out either should give
      same phenotype!
    - Actually, another cytokine, another heterodimer, sharing p40 subunit.
      Caries alternative p19 subunit. Knockout and was fine again.
    - Conclusion, IL-23 not IL-12 required for autoimmunity
    - IL-23 secondary driver?
    - No, IL-17. IL-23 drives completely different type of response to Th1
      response.
    - Take IL23 knockout mice, look at CFU in lung, cant clear bacteria, but
      add IL17A, removes bacteria.
    - Differentiation of Th17, Th1 cells are flexible, not fixed lineages!
      Not a polarising response! PLASTICITY - ability of a differeniated cell
      to take on cytokine characteristics of another
    - Th17 cells causing diabetes?
    - CD4+ T cells, if see IL 12, Th1 cell
    - If see IL6, TGFb, IL23, Th17 cell
    - If see IL25, Il33, Th2 cell
    - Th subsets defined by transcription factors

* In vitro vs in vivo
    - Th2 tissue specialisation - allergic or parasitic response
    - Plasticity in terms of cytokine production
    - Type of cytokines available influences
    - IL4+ but GATA3- IL13- -> Tfh cell
    - Look at location, green = IL4 producers, red=Bcells
    - Located around B cell areas. Follicular helper cells. CXCR5+
    - For CXCL13, essential for cells to enter lymph nodes, transcription
      factor Bcl6
    - Separate out parts of Th2 and Th1 responses

* Also... Developmental! morphological influences of cytokines!
    - Cytokines essential for development of immune response when system
      becomes infected
    - Cytokines essential for how spleen and lymph nodes are formed, etc
    - B cell areas, T cell areas
    - Maintained by chemokine system. CXCR13 made by stromal cells - CXCR5 on
      B cells
