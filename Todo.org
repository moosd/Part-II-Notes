  Describe the signalling mechanisms by which DNA is detected by
  inflammasomes and how the products of inflammasome activation regulate the
  host response to viral infection

** Intro
    - What is the inflammasome
        - How was it discovered? How is it investigated?
    - Why DNA is detected
    - Where the DNA might come from - parasites, bacteria, viruses, own
      cells, what might stop it from being detected
    - DNA degradation products as proxy for DNA - uric acid
** Detection
    - Initial receptors for these ligands
        - Evidence
        - experiments
** Signal transduction
    - Secondary messengers
        - evidence and experiments
** Assembly of inflammasome
    - Assembly of inflammasomes
        - different types, different expts
** Result of inflammasome, e.g. with viral infection
    - How it works
        - outputs
    - Possible outcomes in viral infection - ISGs, etc
** Aberrant activation
    - What happens when it goes wrong?
