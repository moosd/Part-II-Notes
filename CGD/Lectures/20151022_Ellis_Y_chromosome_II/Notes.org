#+AUTHOR Dr Peter Ellis, University of Kent
#+DATE Thu 22 Oct, 2015

* Slide 1
 - Genetic sex determination
 - Chromosome for sex determination
 - Degeneration
 - Dosage compensation
 - Gene traffic reduced
 - Preferential retention of fertility genes on Y

* Slide 2, 3
 - No notes taken

* Slide 4
 - Genes for female fitness preferentially selected more efficiently on X chromosome
 - Cleared mutations on X because exposed to selection pressures, as opposed to recessive mutation in autosome that can hide
 - 1/3 fully exposed, purifying selection more efficient
 - Better synaptic connections, or any highly selected for function (e.g. intelligence) likely to evolve on X
 - X more readily accumulates
 - Faster X effect
 - Evolutionary testbed
 - Beneficial effects kept
 - Evolves faster, accumulating highly selective functions
 - X chromosomes exposed in males - *HEMIZYGOUS EXPOSURE*
 - Diseases on autosomes rarely associated with learning disorder

* Slide 5
 - Autism appears as male-specific
 - Segregates as X linked recessive
 - Ovarian insufficiency due to small deletion on X, premature menopause

* Slide 6
 - OMIM

* Slide 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
 - No notes taken

* Slide 13
 - X enriched for intellectual functions

* Slide 14
 - Fertility genes

* Slide 15
 - dips = deletions
 - may be ~10% dip because mosaicism

* Slide 16, 17
 - No notes taken

* Slide 18
 - Housekeeping genes - very strong selection to keep them in

* Slide 19
 - Fertility issues = few children = small pedigrees!

* Slide 20
 - No notes taken

* Slide 21
 - XO as XX missing X, but also as XY missing Y
 - Missing Y = missing maleness
 - Also missing all these other genes

* Slide 22
 - No notes taken

* Slide 23
 - SHOX gene responsible for short stature in PAR
 - Gene not inactivated because in PAR
 - Acid test for gene function - can find a de novo mutation with it, no pedigree, mutation not present before.
 - Idiopathic - no history

* Slide 24
 - Lymphoedema locus, same genes on X and Y at different places

* Slide 25
 - Skeletal growth locus - non-stature, other abnormalities

* Slide 26
 - Ovarian phenotype - many deletions, cause of lack of fertility and intelligence

** Discuss value of animal models
 - Can set up experiments that cant be set up ethically in humans
 - Have much larger pedigrees vs one or two children in humans

* Slide 27
 - No notes taken

* Slide 28
 - Dont have pedigrees on Y chromosome
 - Only approach is same as that used to identify Sry
 - Physical mapping - lost bits of chromosome
 - Look at phenotype and correlate with physical loss of bits of DNA

* Slide 29
 - AZF discovered in 1990s

* Slide 30
 - Type II SCO - degenerative phenotype
 - Lots of germ cells die. Normally removed by Sertoli cells, but these become overloaded
 - Eventually lose all germ cells completely
 - Age dependant!
 - Clinically, may not have noticed infertility for 20 years
 - Secondary changes obscure original phenotype
 - Modelling in animals important methodology - uncover disease pathogenesis when complex degenerative phenotype in humans

* Slide 31
 - Degenergation - before, just enough sperm, now not enough?

* Slide 32
 - Koch's postulates but for gene function
 - Cant do them most of the time!

* Slide 33
 - Oligospermia - smaller deletion
 - Azoospermia - larger deletion
 - Azoospermia pseudogene deletions - may have silenced downstream genes?
 - Animal models - can take testis sample more easily to investigate!

* Slide 34, 35
 - No notes taken

* Slide 36
 - AZFc region difficult to pin down - many repeats (copies of genes)

* Slide 37, 38, 39
 - No notes taken

* Slide 40
 - X silencing

* Slide 41
 - Deletion of AZFa common
 - Flanked by two retrovirus elements
 - Mispairing between repeats -> extra prone to this because of cruft
 - Deletion chops out AZFa

* Slide 42
 - No notes taken

* Slide 43
 - During pairing and recombination, X and Y dont pair properly together
 - Autosomes remain transcriptionally active
 - Unpaired chromosomes - indicative of potential DSB - common because recombination - hence, silenced
 - Hence Y transcriptionally silent
 - But if these genes are off during meiosis, and there are key housekeeping genes on these chromosomes, what happens?
 - Housekeeping genes copied onto autosome, autosome copy may be testis specific
 - Only in males because only males have Y chromosome! Females have XX and these pair well.

* Slide 44, 45
 - No notes taken

* Slide 46
 - gr/gr = green-red amplicon
 - Structure predisposes to rearrangements

* Slide 47
 - Structure predisposes to mispairing and deletions - so why is it beneficial?

* Slide 48, 49
 - No notes taken

* Slide 50
 - They evolve locked in step but no effect on deletions

* Slide 51
 - An explanation which uses XY dynamics needed

* Slide 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67
 - No notes taken

* Slide 68
 - X for intelligence and fertility
 - One gene for determining sex
 - To chromosome for it
 - X and Y differing structurally
 - Causes differences in function, different functional genes accumulate on each
 - Ongoing evolutionary process feeding back on itself
