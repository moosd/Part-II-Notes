* Intro
- Balance between activating enough to fight off infection
- But not too much or suffer from autoimmune disease
- CTLA4 -/- k/o leads to massive infiltration, mice die within 3 weeks
- CD28 needed, but without CTLA4, response goes wild -> autoimmunity
- (Alegre et al, 2001)

* Simple Model
- CD28 lowers response threshold on both resting and activated
- CTLA4 increases response threshold, but expressed only after activation

- Normally, ~20% of T cells die through apoptosis
- CD28 keeps them alive
- (Rudd and Schneider, 2003)
- YMNM motif

* CTLA4 vs CD28
- CTLA4 is mostly intracellular molecule, if some on cell surface, is rapidly internalised
- CD28 -> NFkB -> proinflammatory
- Lew Cantley - PI3K
- PI3K -> lipids -> mTOR?
- PI3K -> PDK1 -> AKT -> p-BAD (antiapoptotic pathway)

* CTLA4
- CTLA4 -> Tcons (conventional) -> low, intracellular expression
- Tregs -> constitutively express CTLA4 on surface - needed for function
- binds to CD86 (B7) with 50 fold higher affinity than CD28
- at immunological synapse, CTLA4 outcompetes CD28
- cell cycle arrest
- unlike CD28, able to bind to different ends of CD80/86
- AVIDITY EFFECTS - outcompetes
- CTLA4 -/- mice (Tivol et al, 1995)
- die by 3 weeks, infiltration
- redundancy? Surprising that we rely so much on a single molecule...
- SNPs -> CTLA4 mutations in and around gene, linked to autoimmune disease
- CTLA4 signalling not clear
- D3 lipids from PI3K
- activates pro-survival pathway (and prevents proliferation)
- In order to keep anergic/stasis, keep alive! May need later!

- SHP2 - phosphatase dephosphorylates tyrosine residues- not clear, no binding site
- If does do this, must do it indirectly
- Aside from this, model is that it could dephosphorylate TCR ITAMs preventing signalling

- Cytoplasmic tails also needed! Ko of extracellular bit does not save mice
- Cell intrinsic factors

- Take bone marrow from CTLA4 -/-, into SCID mouse, leave for 1/2 months, disease
- Add a few, not many, CTLA4 +/+ cells along with CTLA4-/- bone marrow, saves mice, completely normal
- Tregs somehow regulate phenotype?

- CTLA4-/- on FoxP3 +ve background
- only on Tregs
- Delay in disease, 7/8 weeks -> dead

- No negative signal? Strong positive signal leading to a negative effect?
- Reverse stop signal model (Rudd)
- Stop signal (peptide) -> to ensure good contact
- CTLA4 limits contact with APCs
- Hence inhibitory but no negative signal
- Contact with cell intrinsic (reducing motility) and extrinsic (competition) effect

- Effects only seen in conventional cells
- Function of CTLA4 -> take Tregs with lots of constitutive expression of CTLA4 and an APC
- Counterstain for CD80/86
- Sucks it up, competes for ligands from CD28
- Hence Tregs suck up APC costim molecules, ligand not available to activate normal T cells, so these may enter anergy rather than activate or not stim TCR at all

* Treatments
- Immune Checkpoint modulation
- GVAX - like adjuvant, GM-CSF expression
- Ineffective by own in humans
- GVAX + antiCTLA4 = synergy, great success
- (Hodi et al, 2010)

- CTLA4 + binding to CD80/86 on APC cause APC to secrete IDO
- acts on tryptophan to create immunomodulatory metabolites
- IDO secreted by tumours too in their microenvironment

- exhausted T cells - dont secrete much cytokines
- Dont kill much
- Block PD-1, reinvigorated immune response
- Eliminates virus
- PD1 signalling straightforward - ITIM/ITSM -> binds SHP1/2
- CTLA4 acts on induction phase of response
- PD1 acts on cytolytic phase

- Ipilimumab to clinical study - Postow et al, 2015
- Pumbro = anti PD1 antibody, vs chemo-therapy

* Future
- All coreceptors!
- Especially those expressed on Tregs!
