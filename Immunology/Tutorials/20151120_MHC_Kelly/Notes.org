* MHC
    - ERp57 has a thioreductase complex that can break S-S bonds in ER
    - Do it in endosomal compartments? Unlikely...
    - MHC Class II more resistant to proteolysis, more than class I
    - Cross presentation - endosomally derived antigen onto class I, if
      dendritic cell cannot be infected, other mechanism to generate CTLs
    - Use same sort of machinery and editing capacity - use ER loading
      chaperone system, if two different mechanisms, would we get the same
      peptides?

* Mutagenesis
    - EMS - gives deletion mutations
    - Other ones can give different types of mutations
    - Selecting out phenotype desired (20-30years ago, these days can use
      FACS sorting) - then, kill all cells still had receptor wanted to get
      rid of, use Ab to bind to target, complement to kill them

* T cella activation
    - Signalling theshold, because TCRs can bind all sorts of MHC peptide
      complexes, with different specificities
    - Want to make long lived CTLs for chronic infections, long lived
      (herpesviruses) have a LOT of molecules that evade MHC presentation
      pathways
    - virally infected cell, awful lot of the same protein
    - Many viruses, want an antibody response generated.
    - HLA-DM ensures peptides wont fall off when peptide gets to surface at
      different pH
    - Editing machinery gets rid of peptides with fast off rate
    - 1hour to 6 hours to 24 hours - duration of MHC on surface of cell
    - Class II binds anything that enters endocytic pathway

* Does everywhere have the immunoproteosome?
    - Lots of staining on vascular endothelium, very little on tissues, so all
      cells express class I, but not very much. Places likely to have infection,
      have more class I and immunoproteosomes
    - When need to present antigen, upregulated!
    - type I and type II interferons -> class I upregulation
    - gamma interferons activate class II

* Epitopes changing
    - Have a number of peptide epitopes that are generally generated. Some
      epitopes destroyed b/c readily cleaved. Found that internalised antigen
      with different B cells with different B cell receptor binding to
      different bits of toxoid, different peptides presented on MHC!
    - Reasonably well folded protein, need to do something to it! To begin to
      open up protein to allow proteases to access (thioreductases, pH
      change) - weak spot opened up first, allows access, determines how it
      is degraded
    - Play around with it, must find another weak spot, influences how rest
      of protein degraded
    - Important :: Bind antibody to self protein, peptide epitopes to self protein not
      generated in thymus!!!
    - EPITOPE SPREADING :: during the course of an immune response, epitopes to
      which made response initially to are altered over the course of the
      response
    - Also changes in SEQUENCE in viruses can have same effect! Different
      weak spot, different peptides presented on T cells
    - DNA vaccines work in some settings, make protein, cleave it up,
      generate T cell responses against those epitopes.

    - First crystal structures, dimer of dimers, ability to associate
      inherently (artifact of crystallisation?)
    - Cross presentation class II showing class I
    - Cytosolic proteins into endosomal compartments - presenting class I
      molecules in class II - some Heat Shock Proteins will do this

    - Mostly see changes in gene expression, not tumour new antigens, mostly
      just see altered levels of normal proteins. So context?
    - Wound repair, switch to alternatively activated macrophage type
      scenario
    - LINK :: To Macrophage support for cancers?
