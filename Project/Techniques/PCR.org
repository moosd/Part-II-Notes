* Not getting two bands, one small one large?
    - Due to small amplicon using far more resources (since goes more
      quickly) than the large one
    - Hence small band shows up but large one higher up does now

* Non specific bands
    - No band expected, can have some non specific amplification
    - Drowned out by specific amplification
