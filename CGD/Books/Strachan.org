* Pedigrees
- p 79 - 1900s, mendelians vs biometricians - solved by fischers theoretical model

- complications to mendelian pedigrees - variable expression - type I Waardenburg (autosomal dominant)
- penetrance
- age related penetrance, e.g. huntingdons - slow accumulation of a substance, incremental tissue death, or inability to repair some environmental damage

- mitochondria are not self sufficient - some diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction due to nuclear mutation hence Mendelian pedigrees
- PAR diseases - Leri-Weill dyschondrosteiosis -> dwarfism
- Bias of ascertainment - segregation ratio for recessive conditions not 0.25? No independant way of detecting carrier? Only affected families identified, those with only carriers missed
- Above is complete truncate ascertainment
- Single selection - family with more children affected more likely to be picked up
- Subtle biases in non  recessive conditions distorting estimated biases
- Beadle and Tatum - one gene one enzyme hypothesis
- But no one to one correspondance bwteen transcriptional units and phenotypes for three types of heterogeneity:
   + Locus heterogeneity :: Same phenotype from many loci - epistasis
   + Allelic heterogeneity :: Different mutations in different patients, same phenotype
   + Clinical heterogeneity :: Mutations in same gene -> two phenotypes - HPRT -> gout or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (severe mental retardation)
- Pleiotropy - different - same gene mutation, multiple effects in same organism

- giuemsa staining stains low gc areas dark
- mitochondrial genes as pseudogenes in nuclear dna
- processed pseudogenes lack promoter
- can be reincorporated into genome from cdna, intronless retrogenes, typically homologs of intron containing X gene
- rationale is during male meiosis, XY body forms, inactivated x and y chromosomes
- autosomal retrogenes provide continued synthesis of crucial proteins

- rna world hypothesis, rich and woese in 1960s

- small rna transcripts known to be useful in aiding gene expression, mostly posttranscriptional processing
- labelled snrna to distinguish from pre-mRNA
- many known to be uridine rich and so nanmed accordingly
- U2 snRNA does not refer to famous irish rock band but second uridine rich small nuclear rna to be classified
- snRNPs - ribozymes

- rna editing changes sequence after transcription - p 374

- phagemids
- contig clones

* Genome alignment
- Waterman algorithm minimises mismatches
- Needleman-Wunsch maximises matches

- contiguous gene syndromes - well defined for X chromosomes, lots of nearby genes deleted

- estrogen receptor held in cytoplasm by hsp90
