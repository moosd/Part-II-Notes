 - DNA broken down to uric acid which is sensed
 - erythema - redness from vasodilation
 - increase in permeability due to contracting endothelium - histamine
 - 3 chemotactic gradients - cxcl8, complement (c5a) and arachidonic acid (ltb4)

 - lipoxins supress inflammation, intermediates made by leukocytes, finished by platelets
 - very large increases in vasc permeability allow fibrinogen to pass out of blood
 - characteristic of lining of body cavities

 - histiocytes = phagocytes in lymph nodes

 - fever = pge2

 - acute phase proteins - crp, serum amyloid a, fibrinogen
 - fibrinogen binds to red cells, causes them to form stacks (rouleaux) that sediment more rapidly - hence erythrocyte sedimentation rate test for testing for inflammatory response by any stimulus


 - liver - canals of Hering - progenitor cells for when hepatoytes cannot relicate
 - 90% of liver can replicate
 - hepatocyte regeneration - priming by il6 from kupffer cells to prime parenchymal cells to receive and respond to growth factor
 - growth factor phase - HGF and TGF-\alpha produced by many cell types act on primed hepatocytes
 - few hours to reenter cell cycle
 - Wave of hepatocyte regeneration followed by replication of nonparenchymal cells
 - Termination phase, hepatocytes return to quiescence


 - antiphospholipid syndrome - false +ve test for syphilis because antigen bound on cardiolipin
 - libman-sacks endocarditis - sterile vegetations w/ lupus
 - nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis

 - the bends named after 1880s then popular womens fashion pose, the Grecian bend
 - people arched their backs in the same way
 - more chronic - caisson disease named for pressurized vessels used in brigge construction
 - persistence of gas emboli in the skeletal system leads to multiple foci of ischemic necrosis

 - red infarct in testicular torsion

 - polycythemia vera - neoplasm with too many rbcs - phlebotomy

 - Budd-Chiari syndrome - occlusion of hepatic veins - triad of abdominal pain, ascites, liver enlargement
 - primary - thrombosis
 - secondary - outside structure compressing - e.g. tumour

 - lupus anticoagulant - anticoagulant in vitro, procoagulant in vivo

 - shock - state of systemic tissue hypoperfusion, due to reduced cardiac output, and/or reduced effective circulating blood volume

 - acute spinal or brain injuries can lead to neurogenic shock

 - some congenital diseases not genetic - congenital syphilis
 - some genetic diseases not from birth - e.g. huntingdons
 - vitamin d resistant rickets - dominant X linked

 - exact multiple of haploid number of chromosomes (23) = euploid
 - not this = aneuploid
 - non disjunction and anaphase lag

 - ring chromosomes
 - inversions compat with life
 - isochromosome formation - most ommonly long arm of X - i(X)(q10)

* Downs
 - Trisomy 21
** Not dependant on maternal age
 - partial trisomy 21 (translocation)
 - mosaic trisomy 21 (non disjunction during early embryo)

* Turners
 - Loss of entire X chromosome
 - isochromosome i(X)(q10)
 - mosaic
 - markedly distended lymphatic vessels -> cystic hygroma -> webbed neck

 - fetal ovaries develop normally early, but absence of second X leads to accelerated loss of oocytes, completed by 2 years
 - menopause before menarche

* Fragile X
 - oogenesis can amplify triplet repeat
 - hence more likely in grandsons than brothers of transmitting males
 - premutation in grandfather amplified to full mutation in mother

 - leber hereditary optic neuropathy = mitochondrial disease
 
 - FISH
 - mutiple ligation dependant probe amplification - hybridisation, ligation, amplification
   + readily detects deletions affecting one or more exons that would escape PCR and conventional DNA sequencing

 - detect epigenetic changes - sodium bisulphite to convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil
 - methylated are protected from the change

* Immune pathology
 - Abs against dsDNA and Smith antigen = SLE
 - SLE drug induced by d-penicillamine, hydralazine

 - graft - immunosupression - reactivation of polyoma virus - latent infection of lower genitourinary tract, infects renal tubules, 

 - HIV can only replicate in active T cells, not naive T cells which have APOBEC active (but vif tries to counteract it)
 - Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma

 - Congo red to stain for amyloidosis
 - Bence Jones proteins = Ig light chains
