* Slide 1
 - No notes taken

* Slide 2
 - Chromosomes and disease - scientist vs clinician

* Slide 3, 4
 - No notes taken

* Slide 5
 - 30nm fibers as decondensed as normal DNA undergoing transcription gets

* Slide 6, 7, 8
 - No notes taken

* Slide 9
 - Genes silent when folded into chromosome, just when dividing
 - Doing stuff when decondensed

* Slide 10
 - Chromosome 5 in green
 - In same domain when decondensed

* Slide 11
 - No notes taken

* Slide 12
 - Frogs - different species have different numbers of chromosomes, one species has 26
 - Bottom right - tomato

* Slide 13
 - No notes taken

* Slide 14
 - Cell must be dividing - often overlooked
 - Plant root tip - lots of cell division, but often not like this.
   + Roadblock with colchicine to get 3% in dividing state
 - Hypotonic solution, but dont want cells to burst
 - Fixed to glass slide
 - Chromosomes must be stained else transparent!

* Slide 15
 - Cheek cells nice but not actively dividing - hence need blood
 - Blood not too useful, if want to test prenatally for Downs syndrome for example
 - Cancer diagnosis from bone marrow or from individual tumour
 - Sperm, different approach needed

* Slide 16
 - Aseptic technique, because if there is a bad infection, no amount of antibiotics will help!
 - PHA is a lectin that forces lymphocytes into dividing
 - 72 hours = weekend
 - Methanol/acetic acid mix made up fresh, otherwise they react with one another

* Slide 17
 - Harvest :: culture then obtain chromosomes

* Slide 18
 - CVS out of favour now, differential results (mosaicism)
 - Skin not as convenient - blood + PHA = 3 days, skin very variable from person to person
 - Early diagnosis important for therapeutic abortion

* Slide 19
 - 14-16 weeks for amniocentesis
 - Amniocentesis from top through abdomen

* Slide 20
 - Two methods
 - extract mesenchymal core from villus (extraembryonic mesoderm)
 - Pro :: Nicer chromosomes
 - Con :: 2 weeks to culture
 - Whole villus into medium, 3hrs, hypotonic solution, etc, then drag across slide
 - Pro :: Fast and easy, same day answer
 - Con :: Short stubby chromosomes. If chromosomes different between placenta and fetus, may give erroroneous result
 - CVS transabdominally preferred because similar to amniocentesis
 - Or transvaginally, looks brutal...

* Slide 21
 - No notes taken

* Slide 22
 - Or cells from fetus itself, from leg if ambiguity

* Slide 23
 - No notes taken

* Slide 24
 - Trypsin digestion allows for banding patterns

* Slide 25
 - lighter bands = more gene rich areas

* Slide 26
 - No notes taken

* Slide 27
 - Probe labelled directly or with fluorescence reporter

* Slide 28
 - No notes taken

* Slide 29
 - 95 oC = melting point of DNA
 - Formamide brings it down to 65-70 oC
 - Overnight at 37oC
 - Indirectly :: binding with biotin because lasted longer and easier to change colours, but these days fluorescent probes are a lot more stable
 - Must be stained in diff colour, else no frame of reference

* Slide 30
 - No notes taken

* Slide 31
 - Red for orientation
 - Bottom left picture :: translocation abnormality

* Slide 32
 - Red + green = yellow
 - 24 chromosomes in different colours

* Slide 33
 - No notes taken

* Slide 34
 - Preimplantation diagnosis - can safely remove one cell, only implant normal ones
 - e.g. only implant females for DMD families
 - Also to diagnose Downs from three dots not two
 - Bottom left, 18 and X, 18 and Y = haploid cells, male because Y chromosome
 - Embryos, sperm, cancer - FISH without chromosome preparation

* Slide 35
 - No notes taken

* Slide 36
 - 1971 convention

* Slide 37
 - No notes taken

* Slide 38
 - World map vs street map
 - Chromosome 7 band -> cystic fibrosis
 - X -> DMD locus
 - Order of genes same everytime
 - Karyotype - low resolution map of human genome

* Slide 39, 40
 - No notes taken

* Slide 41
 - Count - expect 46, 45/47 = problem

* Slide 42
 - No notes taken

* Slide 43
 - But sequencing, always a little sequence after centromere, hence no true telocentric?
 - p arm visible but no longer than width of chromosome = acrocentric
 - All mice chromosomes telocentric? (/acrocentric?)

* Slide 44, 45, 46
 - No notes taken

* Slide 47
 - Chromosomal - numeric, structural

* Slide 48
 - Deletions, duplication, etc, = net gain/loss of DNA

* Slide 49
 - No notes taken

* Slide 50
 - Leading cause of pregnancy loss
 - FIrst trimester loss, half due to chromosomal abnormalities
 - 2/3 of these due to aneuploidy

* Slide 51
 - Never see trisomy 1, rarely trisomy 19

* Slide 52, 53
 - No notes taken

* Slide 54
 - X chromosome larger, more genes, yet not as major phenotype effects?
 - Because of X inactivation
 - Only one gene active on inactive chromosome, and inactive on active chromosome - Xist
 - Like chickenwire around chromosome, moves it to periphery of nucleus
 - (end of first lecture)

* Slide 55, 56
 - No notes taken

* Slide 57
 - Triploidy = duplication of ALL chromosomes, not same thing as trisomy
 - Spontaneous abortions ~8% triploid
 - 1/3 of these normal sperm into diploid eggs
 - 2/3 two sperms into same egg, esp with IVF

* Slide 58, 59
 - No notes taken

* Slide 60
 - Number of genes lost, whether they are involved in developmental processes

* Slide 61, 62, 63
 - No notes taken

* Slide 64
 - Duplications/insertions - partial trisomy, not a whole extra chromosome, just a bit

* Slide 65, 66
 - No notes taken

* Slide 67
 - Fertility problems or pregnancy loss

* Slide 68
 - No notes taken

* Slide 69
 - 45 chromosomes, trisomy 3, actually 13/14 fusion
 - Acrocentric - fuse to end to end

* Slide 70, 71, 72
 - No notes taken

* Slide 73
 - Pairing cross
 - Slows meiosis down, hence infertility
 - Also leads to unbalanced gametes

* Slide 74
 - No notes taken

* Slide 75
 - Paracentric :: not involving centromere
 - Pericentric :: across centromere

* Slide 76
 - No notes taken

* Slide 77
 - Inversions form a pairing loop
 - Translocations form a pairing cross

* Slide 78
 - No notes taken

* Slide 79
 - X chromosomes break a lot esp while culturing cells
 - Hence fragile X name

* Slide 80
 - No notes taken

* Slide 81
 - XXX not as serious fertility issues

* Slide 82
 - No notes taken

* Slide 83
 - Infertile because of other trisomies -> fatal

* Slide 84
 - No notes taken

* Slide 85
 - Smoking increases sperm anuploidy also chemotherapy

* Slide 86
 - Kleinfelters XXY
 - half of cases from XY disomic sperm
 - half from XX egs fertilised by Y egg
 - In picture, Y green, X yellow, 21 red

* Slide 87
 - 5-10x increase associated with severe male factor infertility
 - Usually sex chromosome issues

* Slide 88
 - Coates et al, Fertility and Sterility
 - Babies with more genetic abnormalities? Effects mostly in sex chromosomes

* Slide 89
 - No notes taken

* Slide 90
 - Boundaries getting blurred
 - TSGs regulate cell division, keeps genes in check. Deletion -> tumor
 - Oncogenes - overactive, amplified -> itself causes cancer
 - Tumour alone - no blood samples (unless leukemia!)
 - Consistent translocations can also indicate there is an oncogene (not aneuploidy)

* Slide 91
 - 9:22 translocation
 - Chromosome 9 varies in length person to person
 - Chromosome 22 easy to spot
 - BCR drives transcription of ABL as fusion product
 - Cytogenetic story to therapy
 - 9:22 translocation identified
 - FISH to assay for it
 - cheaper PCR method
 - Gleevec (imatinib) targets fusion protein product of gene for CML patients

* Slide 92
 - Grey looking thing - oncogene amplified several times
 - Lots of dots looking like bacteria - actually amplified oncogene?
 - CGH - hybridise normal DNA (green) and tumour (red)
 - 1:1 signal = yellow
 - Skewing of signal = tumour mutation

 - Gain info on gene order

* Slide 118
 - Treat with detergent, stretch out

* Slide 119, 120
 - No notes taken

* Slide 121
 - Barr body with Giemsa
 - Not much more until FISH
 - Different chromosomes, different locations
 - Gene density - rich in middle, poor on periphery
 - Transcriptional active cells -> gene density
 - Not so transcriptionally active -> chromosome size
 - So depends on cell line

* Slide 122
 - Tiny chromosome, gene rich?

* Slide 123
* Cells of the eye, other way round!

* Slide 124
 - Flatten out
 - Middle? Could be a chromosome on periphery folded in
 - Periphery? Probably there

 - Array CGH used a lot to replace traditional cytogenetics
 - Net gain or loss -> accurate diagnosis
 - Next generation sequencing of small bit
 - Similar results, but much cleaner signal
 - Starting to replace array CGH
