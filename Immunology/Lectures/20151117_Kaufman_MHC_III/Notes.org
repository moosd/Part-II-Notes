* Intro
    - Such and such is linked to mhc - which one is it linked to?
    - Linkage disequilibrium
      Two markers found more often than expected, doesnt break up with
      recombination as much
    - Not enough time to break up haplotypes?
    - HFE - high iron (fe)
    - Two issues with mapping
        - One, just because it has segregation with classical MHC allele, not
          necessarily causing it
        - LD between distant markers also an issue

* Most of literature
    - Not GWAS, classical mapping
    - dominance recessiveness an epiphenomenon of genetic consequences

* What makes MHC polymorphic
    - Transplantation an epiphenomenon - T cells selection
    - Mixed lymphocyte reaction, 10% of T cells will react with any given
      allo MHC molecule
    - Arms race with pathogens
    - Heterozygosity gives selective advantage
    - MHC has most genetic associations with disease, but mostly autoimmune
    - NK cells often involved with pathogens
    - Funny, why are infectious pathogen associations not so strong?
    - Most classical association to class II, but some now class I thanks to
      GWAS (weaker association)
    - anti TNF alpha rescues a lot of rheumatoid arthritis cases
    - Constellation of loci that really give the disease
    - Shared epitope in HLA-DR4 - run of residues that had positive charges
      important for association.
    - Heavy smoking - environmental trigger for rheumatoid arthritis
    - Arginine -> citrulline, no positive charges
    - Trick for several disease
    - Links mechanistically the genetic susceptibility and environmental
      trigger with disease
    - Vimentin, agrecan bound
    - Not original peptides coming from proteins
    - DRB1*04:02 does opposite
    - Selected against arginine containing peptides, not citrulline peptides
    - T cells may have just enough affinity that T cells start doing damage
    - Have a T cell at just border of able to react, not negatively selected
      but could recognise normal peptide if turned on, needs co-stimulation
      to get going, then causes autoimmunity
    - Ankylosing spondylitis - class I association, 95% HLA-B27, other
      factors, genetic and environmental
    - People in north more likely to get AS
    - Vitamin D important for immune function, depends on sunlight, another
      environmental trigger?

* Celiac disease
    - More like an allergy
    - Described by Aretaeus from Cappadochia
    - Protein in wheat - gluten is trigger
    - Oats have high Q but low P -> not very toxic
    - low Q, high A, L in maize zeins and proteins from millet and rice and
      not toxic
    - GENETIC! Can be tested,
    - Mostly glutamamine, tissue transglutaminase = autoantigen
    - Enzyme secreted when stress, normally intracellular, released in
      wounding or infection, turns glutamine to glutamic acid, now LOTS of
      negative charges, peptides that bind have lots of negative charges
    - Needs to be proline-rich, prevents ERAP from chewing and destroying
      them
    - No reaction for a long time, then something triggers tTG, then T cells
      against gluten, tissue damage -> more tTG released
    - Can avoid gluten, to prevent this? Or inhibit tTG

* Autoimmunity
    - Need an immune system to go after things vigorously, bt will result in
      tissue damage. Needs a balance!
    - In other cases, NOT having a response leads to autoimmunity - hygeine
      hypothesis!
    - Set up immune system to focus on worms not any old thing? Respources
      directed to strong stimuli rather than weaker self stimuli
    - Only happen to people when order. Post reproductive people not under
      selection?
    - Not driver of polymorphism...

* Mate choice
    - Something a species focusses on as marker - undergoes rapid evolution
      and gets more of it
    - Peacock's tail. No conceivable advantage to having enormous tail, quite
      a disadvantage, predators can catch them, really obvious
    - Not great but attract females, end up with lots of offspring
    - Reproductive variation important for future generation
    - MHC has an effect on number of offspring that happen - higher fitness
    - Which inbred/congenic mouse strains wanted to mate with whom?
    - Lots of different things to select for
    - Humans - T shirt experiments for body odour
    - What was being recognised was not peptides but tripeptides,
      cross-fostering shows this is a learned response

* Infectious disease
    - Pretty weak, strongest are viruses
    - HLA-Bw53 important for avoiding cerbral malaria
    - HTLV - human T lymophotrophic virus
    - But hard to demonstrate!
    - Anchor residues are mutated by HIV to escape CTLs
    - Elite controllers have B27 that targets particular peptide hard for
      virus to escape from
    - B5701 - over 30years and havent developed AIDS
    - NK cells important too
    - Elite controlling HLA bind few peptides, Super death HLA binds lots of
      peptides
    - Few significant associations, to MHC at HCP5 - endogenous retrovirus,
      6.5% of set point correlation
    - Historic selection provie evidence for infectious disease. Synonymous
      changes unselected, accumulates
    - HIgh dN/dS where peptide is bound
    - Conurbation - lots of little bands, each one developed own MHC to fight
      off own pathogens
    - Then when we went into cities, 2000 alleles as another epiphenomenon
      where 20 would be enough?
