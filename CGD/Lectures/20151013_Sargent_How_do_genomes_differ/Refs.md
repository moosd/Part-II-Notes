CNVs can be recurrent (NAHR) or non recurrent (NHEJ/FoSTeS)
De novo CNVs occur 100-1000 times more frequently than point mutations  (apparent frequency depends on resolution of tech used to reveal them

Mech of disease:
- Alter gene dosage - particularly frequent in mentl retardation
    - Deletion of MECP -> Rett syndrome, duplication -Lubs X linked MRS
- Alter copy number of regulators (non coding regiions)
- Susceptibility factors for disease (Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome)
- Frequently, genes for development surrounded by gene deserts - spatial and temporal regulation (eg Sox9, Pierre Robin, Cooks syndrome)
- 3C to investigate enhancer effects

- 2q31 - dup - HOXD - Mesomelic dysplasia Kantaputra type
- 2q35 - dup - IHH  - Syndactyly type 1, craniosynostosis Philadelphia type
- 7q36 - dup - SHH - Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome, preaxial polydactyly type 2, Werner mesomelic syndrome, Haas polysyndactyly, Laurin-Sandrow syndrome
- 17q24.3 - dup - SOX9 - Cook syndrome
- 17q24.3 - del - SOX9 - Pierre Robin syndrome
                      - Many overlapping features with Sticker syndrome, mutations in COL2A1, target of SOX9
- Mut -> Campomelic dysplasia
