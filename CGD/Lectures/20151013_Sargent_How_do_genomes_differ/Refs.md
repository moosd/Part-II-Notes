CNVs can be recurrent (NAHR) or non recurrent (NHEJ/FoSTeS)
De novo CNVs occur 100-1000 times more frequently than point mutations  (apparent frequency depends on resolution of tech used to reveal them

Mech of disease:
- Alter gene dosage - particularly frequent in mentl retardation
    - Deletion of MECP -> Rett syndrome, duplication -Lubs X linked MRS
- Alter copy number of regulators (non coding regiions)
- Susceptibility factors for disease (Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome)
- Frequently, genes for development surrounded by gene deserts - spatial and temporal regulation (eg Sox9, Pierre Robin, Cooks syndrome)
- 3C to investigate enhancer effects

CNVs in Long range regulators

- 2q31 - dup - HOXD - Mesomelic dysplasia Kantaputra type
- 2q35 - dup - IHH  - Syndactyly type 1, craniosynostosis Philadelphia type
- 7q36 - dup - SHH - Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome, preaxial polydactyly type 2, Werner mesomelic syndrome, Haas polysyndactyly, Laurin-Sandrow syndrome
- 17q24.3 - dup - SOX9 - Cook syndrome
- 17q24.3 - del - SOX9 - Pierre Robin syndrome
                      - Many overlapping features with Stickler syndrome, mutations in COL2A1, target of SOX9
- Mut -> Campomelic dysplasia
- 20p12 - dup - BMP2 - Brachydactyly type 2
- Xp - del - SHOX - Leri Weill dynchrondrosteoisis
- Xq22 - del - PLP1 - Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease

- RFLPs
- VNTRs
- STRPs
- SNPs
- CNVs
- Whole genome sequencing

# Laird, 2010
Bisulphite - C->T, but other strand untouched, so sequence both strands

# Kong et al, 2009
missing heritibility
- rare alleles not captured by snps
- common alleles with small effects individually that accumulate
- parent of origin effects, epistasis
- gwas errors (Manolino et al, 2009)
   - early gwas - dubious phenotyping and not enough controls masking effect sizes
   - many gwas use only europeans
   - relative risk of marker snps underestimating risk of true causal variant
   - non capture of cnvs
   - fortuituous association

# GWAS examples
## Rheumatoid arthritis
HLA-DRB1
CTLA4
PTPN22

snp in chr 7 showed sex dependant effects in females only- given occurance of ra is much higher in females, possibly significant

PTPN22, MHC, PTPN2, IR2A in common with type I diabetes
## Type I diabetes
similar as both as type iv hypersensitivity
MHC, T lymphocyte pathways
IL2, ERBB3 

IL2, NFAT, TAP1/2 - all in pathways known where major players assoc with disease

## hypertension
dopamine signalling, vascular contraction

# coronary heard disease
9p21.3 risk locus, (Helgadottir et al, 2007)

# obesity
## genes
fto (ft mass and obesity related), first gwas gene to be shown to common non syndromic obesity

mc4r

GIANT (genetic investigation of anthropometric trait) studies giving neuronal genes -> role of cns in predisposition to obesity

## epigenetics
obese mothers, obese children
control mothers weight, control childs weight too
can do retroactive studies using birth weights assoc with adults known to be obese

fto locus is a dna demethylase

prader willi syndrome, imprinting related to satiety centre
albright hereditary osteodysplasia

# type 2 diabetes
most variants appear to act through pertubation of insulin secretion rather than action
