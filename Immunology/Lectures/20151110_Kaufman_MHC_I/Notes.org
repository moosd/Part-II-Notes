* MHC
    - Match for tissue typing
    - Why?
    - H-2 in mice, HLA in humans

* Adaptive immune system
    - Naive require APC
    - Viruses evolve lots of ways to downregulate class I MHC
    - Hence NK cells - see balance of inhibitory and activating molecules,
      one of stress molecules is class I MHC. Not enough MHC class I -> kill
      cells
    - \gamma\delta T cells recognise sorts of stuff too

* Classical
    - Highly polymorphic
    - Lots of amino acid variation
    - Present peptides to T cells
    - Wide tissue distribution
    - Facultative APCs - dont normally have Class II, until triggered by IFN,
      keratinocytes, endothelium in blood vessels, etc

* Non classical
    - Differ in one or more of these attributes
    - Original molecules were classical MHC molecules, more conserved in
      evolution
    - Non classical arise through particular selection mechs
    - 1cM = % of progeny with a recombination event

* Genes
    - Class III - some in immune system, C4, factor B, C2, TNF, Lymphotoxin
      alpha and beta, other peripheral
    - 2245 alleles of HLA-A
    - What is real MHC and what got stuck there by accident?
    - Mouse vs human, genes get moved around and called different things

* Structure
    - Beta 2 microglobulin is in urine when it falls off class I molecules
    - Alpha 3, Beta 2 microglobulin are Ig like domains

* Peptide presentation
    - Nucleus exchanging fluid and proteins with cytoplasm
    - Proteins cut up by proteosome
    - tapasin in peptide editing (quality control) -> Class I, look at
      cytoplasmic and nuclear pathogen
    - Class II takes care of endosomal components (vesicles, topologically
      outside of cell) - different domain, intracellular vesicles
    - Intracellular vesicles seen by Class II - like parasites

* Nomenclature
    - K and D not corresponding to HLA a b c - each species independantly
      expands class I range, NOT orthologues, lineages
    - Class II are orthologues
    - DPA and DPB -> DP alpha and beta, but in mice, psuedogenes
    - HLA-A* = name
    - * 01:01 = alleles, lineages
    - Class I molecules like HLA-A2, but some subtle variants by one or two
      aas but affects binding.
    - Class II, more than one DRB gene, hence DRB5*07:01
    - Like in humans, populations of humans and so lots of shuffling from
      recombination hence haplotypes
    - In mice, inbred strains, haplotypes fixed. Ended up with letters -
      H-2Kb, not dealing with recombinants
    - Haplotypes. In mice, they are clear
    - Haplotype - alleles ialong one chromosome, hence haploid?
    - Some haplotypes more common - unsure whether selected FOR or selected
      AGAINST (everyone else killed or one group better at surviving

* Transplantation
    - Chemicals painted on mice, or viruses, into mice, tried to move tumour
      from one animal to another, failed, so used inbred mice
    - Inbred mice, because pets, mice and rats as pets in far east, like them
      to be different and odd
    - Japanese waltzing mouse - waltzes, defect in inner ear due to recessive
      mutation, must make it breed true by inbreeding
    - Mrs Little kept mice
    - In inbreeding, lots of mice die, the ones that survive are robust
    - allo recognition came from allogeneic

* Genetics
    - P for parent, F for family
    - F2 = F1 x F1
    - Autograft accepted fine
    - But between parents dont work, allogeneic
    - Turns out either parent skin accepted into F1
    - F1 onto parents rejected
    - Codominance, and transplantation senses what is different
    - Not just MHC, but other loci elsewhere determining graft rejection
      segregating independantly
    - 19 different loci, 1 major (mhc) others minor
    - congenic mice :: Made by repeated backcrossing, trying to get MHC on
      different background, dilute out other background genes
    - Finally, F2 cross to get allele d/d onto other background, so now can
      compare same genes everywhere but not MHC
    - Major -> MHC led to rapid allograft rejection
    - Others lest to slower rejection
    - Multiple minor loci -> rapid rejection
    - Minor antigens are peptides with alleles that present on MHC molecules

* Clinical importance
    - Liver can be mismatched a lot
    - Both supression and volume of organ important
    - von Boehmer et al, 1989 - thymys selects the sueful, neglects the
      useless and destroys the harmful
    - Rejection just an epiphenomenom of thumic selecion

* Polymorphisms
    - SNP every 200 bp for entire genome - we are very variable!
    - IMPUTATION to look at MHC SNPs, use SNPs around to associate with genes
      in MHC gene
