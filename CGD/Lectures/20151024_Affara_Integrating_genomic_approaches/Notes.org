#+AUTHOR Professor Nabeel Affara, University of Cambridge
#+DATE Sat 24 Oct, 2015

* Slide 1
- What is meant by a genome project?
- How has it impacted research?
- What technologies are involved?

* Slide 2
- Using other genomes to understand human genome

* Slide 3
- Cytogenetic techniques
- Somatic cell genetics - human cell fused to rodent cell to make hybrid
   + Segregates human chromosomes, choose different cell with individual human chromosome and investigate
   + Cancer - to study metastasis
- Transgenic - to study function, can inactivate genes

* Slide 4
- Build map to single bp level

* Slide 5
- Polymorphic markers - exploit DNA variation
- "Tiling path" constructed
- Genomic library - randomly fragment genome and put into vector, e.g. bacterial artifical chromosome
- BAC up to 1Mbp

* Slide 6
- EST = expressed sequence transcripts
- cDNA shows coding sequences without introns, reg sequences, etc

* Slide 7
- Yeast, C elegans, Drosophila

* Slide 8
- Fugu (puffer fish)
- Protein coding sequences similar to humans

* Slide 9
- Mouse
- Synteny allows mapping genes onto human counterparts

* Slide 10
- Biological is different from biochemical
   + Biological effects can depend on context, different genes expressed in fetus vs adult give different phenotypes - e.g. HGH -> normal growth in kids, acromegaly in adults

* Slide 11, 12
- No notes taken

* Slide 13
- A priori knowledge of genome

* Slide 14
- No clue about gene or protein involved

* Slide 15
- No notes taken

* Slide 16
- Late onset polygenic disease - diseases that manifest later in life, if we can detect and predict this, we can intervene at an earlier stage?

* Slide 17
- non coding RNA - genetic regulation and disease
- Manhattan plot

* Slide 18
- Mutagenesis/phenotype screen - induce mutation, select interesting phenotype and map back onto genome

* Slide 19
- Microarray :: Ordered array of genetic elements immobilised on glass slides, nylon membranes or on a silicon chip
- CGH :: Comparative Genome Hybridisation
- Arrays based on cloned DNA - expression analysis, array CGH
- Oligonucleotide arrays - expression analysis, genotyping, CGH, sequence capture

* Slide 20
- Transcriptional signatures - to target appropriate therapy
- Dual color - printed oligonucleotide + cDNA arrays
- Single color - various in situ synthetised platforms

* Slide 21
- No notes taken

* Slide 22
- 19000 genes
- Transcriptome - also ncRNAs
- Phenome :: what is observed in the individual

* Slide 23
- No notes taken

* Slide 24
- Limited resolution of about 1000 proteins
- Low throughput compared with transcriptome analysis

* Slide 25
- Mass spec with 2D gels

* Slide 26
- Protein based arrays are like microarrays

* Slide 27
- No notes taken

* Slide 28
- Gene silencing

* Slide 29
- Conditional inactivation
- But LoxP is labour intensive, and may not have much of an effect because of genetic redundancy

* Slide 30
- RNAi

* Slide 31
- Rapid, can introduce multiple RNAis at once

* Slide 32
- Start not from gene of interest, but from phenotype and work back to gene
- Complex phenotypes, similar to complex human diseases

* Slide 33, 34, 35
- No notes taken
