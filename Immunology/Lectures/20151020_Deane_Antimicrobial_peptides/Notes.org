* Intro
- Part of innate immunity of all living organisms - made by microbes too!
- kills multidrug resistant strains!
- what are they?
- where are they made?
- how do they work?
- how do they achieve their specificity towards microbes?
- how are they produced?
- how is variety generated?
- how do microbes protect themselves?

* What are they?
- All kingdoms of life
- Potent, broad spectrum
- Small, < 100 aa
- Net +ve charge - Arg, Lys (or His in acidic environments)
- Large proportion of hydrophobic residues
- Disulfide bonds
- Defensins, cathelicidins, ones in the middle
- Made completely unstructured, only adopts conformation in interacting with microbes

* Where are they?
- Epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces
- Granule-containing leukocytes - neutrophils, NK cells, Tc cells, etc
- defensins present in mM concentrations, up to 5% of total protein in cell!

* How do they work?
- direct killing - membrane permeabilisation
- amphipathic - hydrophilic one side, hydrophobic other side to slot into membranes
- Initially carpet model then eventually pore model?
- Pore causes leakage of small ions, depleting transmembrane potential, so no ATP
- water let into cell -> osmotic lysis
- release of metabolites/proteins when even more severe membrane damage
- AMPs can get into cell itself
- Inhibits anything important!
- Interferes with metabolism
- Inhibits cell wall synthesis
- DNA RNA and protein synthesis inhibited
- Certain enzymes inhibited
- May be able to insert into grooves in DNA because of charge and lack of nucleus

* Broad specificity
- AMPs kill:
- Gram positive and negative bacteria
- Mycobacteria
- enveloped viruses
- fungi
- parasites
- cancerous cells

* How are they selective for non-human cells?
- Hydrophobic, hence inserts into membrane
- Initial contact of charged AMP (opposite charge to bacterial membrane) and bacteria
- Bacterial membranes are more anionic (phospholipids, etc) (Hence, more cationic AMP the better) - strong electrostatic interaction
- In order to insert, need certain membrane fluidity. Cholesterol provides this in human cells, not present in bacteria
- Cholesterol - lack of fluidity - reduces activity of AMPs, stabilises bilayers. AMPs struggle to insert, doesn't disturb action much
- Interactions between charged AMPs and cholesterol/glycoproteins?
- Anionic AMPs also exist - but these all need Zn2+ to mediate interaction!

* Also
- Link between innate and adaptive immunity - chemotactic activity
- Recruit neutrophils, monocytes, etc to sites of infection
- Stimulates them to release chemokines from these cells
- Stimulates degranulation of these cells, induce release of NO, promotes phagocytosis
- Binds to chemokine receptors directly? Maybe?

* How are they produced?
- Don't want them floating around freely inside cells (could mess up proteins) or in gut (immunomodulatory effects could be dangerous if not controlled)
- Some are constitutive (e.g. dermicidin)
- Some are triggered (e.g. \beta-defensin by inflammation)
- Can be enhanced by cytokines/microbial products
- Controlled - stored in secretory granules, so not available in cell
- Only released as appropriate
- Often produced as a precursor protein, cleaved by proteases for activity
- Secretory granule with precursor protein, protease in endosomal vesicle or extracellular space
- Bacteria endocytosed, endosome and secretory granule merge
- Or, secretory granule released and cleaved extracellularly
** Case study
- Paneth cells in gut - sense bacteria via MyD88 dependant TLR
- trypsin present in sites in guy
- Activation of AMPs restricted to part of intestinal tract away from stem cells in crypt
- Only want them to become active as they are released from the crypt

* More interesting bits and pieces
- Only one human cathelicidin, hCAP18 in neutrophils, but lots of defensins
- hCAP18 = precursor, cleaved to LL-37 as active peptide
- Unprocessed form also found in seminal plasma
- Together with enzyme, gastricsin, but is inactive at basic pH
- Activated by acidic pH of vagina
- Different cleavage of precursor to lead to different active AMP produced, which affects diff microorganisms
- Prevents infection following sex!

* How is variety generated?
- Same precursor, cleaved by different enzymes into different molecules
- Short peptides can be fused and cyclised in different combinations
- theta-defensins present in primarily non-human primates
- 18-residue circular defensin
- Four subunits can be combined to produce 10 different defensins
- Protection against HIV like viruses
- Humans have a premature stop codon in theta-defensin, but rest of machinery for circularisation, etc, still present
- Stop codon removed, makes retrocyclin, active against HIV (Penburthy et al, 2011)

* How do bacteria defend themselves?
- They can alter their surface charges to repel AMP binding
- Change charge on peptidoglycans, teichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide
- can alter bacterial membrane fluidity
- can make proteases to degrade activity of AMPs or binding proteins to sequester their activity
- Proteolytic attack - hence disulphide bonds and circularisation present, to develop tight, stable peptides.
- use multidrug efflux pumps to remove them from cell

* Resistance by commensals?
- Commensal makes SufA to target and cleave AMPs, degradation products active against pathogen
- Bacteria make own AMPs - bacteriocidins, lantibiotics
- Novel amino acids, e.g. lanthionine - proteases can't act upon them!
- Colicidin made by E coli against E coli
- Vibriocidins made by Vibrio sp against Gram negative bacteria
- nisin made by Lactococcus and used for food preparation

- AMPs can lead to diseases if inappropriately expressed
- Cancers, e.g. colorectal
- Inflammatory conditions from immunomodulatory effects
- arthritis
- Atherosclerosis
- Crohns disease - gut microbiota vs human AMPs - start to damage mucosal cells

* Membrane active peptides
- Short amphipathic peptides
- Pre-amyloid toxins
- Cell penetrating peptides
- Likely not distinct classes

* Amyloid beta as an AMP?
- Cathepsin B inhibitor -> no AD phenotype - immune system involvement!
- Fibrils found in plaques, but these are likely not the disease-causing form
- Soluble form are cytotoxic pore-forming soluble oligomers
- AB has antimicrobial activity
- Mitochondrial damage frequently evident in dementia
- Mitochondria come from bacteria evolutionarily, hence amyloid B localises to mitochondrial membrane and causes damage

* Therapeutics?
- Broad spectrum - even somewhat antiviral
- Act without high specificity - hence less chance of resistance developing
- Bacteriocidal not static
- Short contact time needed for killing
- Frog skin AMPs against many multidrug resistant bacteria eg. Pseudomonas
- Uccelletti, 2010

* Bad aspects
- High concentrations needed for effectiveness
- Harmful immunomodulatory effects if used too much
- Developing resistance to AMPs more dangerous than antibiotic resistance!
- Inhibitors of enzymes responsible for changing bacterial surfaces to make them more susceptible to current AMPs might be a viable option?
