* Intro
- Senescence = metabolically active cells but no mitogenic signalling
- Tumour suppressive mechanism
- (Campisi et al, 2006)
- (Braig et al, 2006)
- Hayflick adn Moorhead, 1961

- cell autonomous effects

* Senescence Associated Heterochromic Foci (SAHC)
- (Narita et al, 2003)
- (Zhang et al, 2005)
- 1 SAHF = 1 chromosome
- E2F targets in center, inactivated
- Expressed bits of DNA on outside
- Layered structure

* High Mobility Group A1
- Alters 3D chromatin structure
- Binds to AT rich DNA
- Expression low in normal cells, increases in senescent cells
- HMGA1 is antitumorogenic -> implications for senescence (Narita et al, 2006)
- Is also tumorogenic -> associated with poor prognosis (Sarhadi et al, 2006)

- Pluripotency - important to maintain - (Kishi et al, 2012)
- (Katez et al, 2005)
- HMGA1 competes with histone H1 for linker DNA to keep nucleosomes apart
- And maintain nucleosome free regions
- ATAC-Seq to identify NFRs (Buenrostro et al, 2013)

* MODEL
- IMR90 fibroblasts, with EstrogenR - HRAS v12
- ER stress caused by HRAS v12 when induced to move to nucleus by tamoxifen (hence senescence)
- Weak phenotype, but inducible
- pBabe RAS - senescence stronger but not inducible

* Where are NFRs?
- Enhancers
- SINEs, LINEs, LTRs
- More open chromatin present in repeat regions

- ATAC-seq gives nice one dimensional data
- DNA DISH gives 3d structure - Kosuke Tomimatsu
- Tet Response Element - 3x Flag HMGA1 - shHMGA1
- short hairpin knocks down endogenous HMGA1, replaces with flag tagged protein

- Sono-seq

- HMGA1 binds to AT rich regions genome wide

* Model for disease
- Fibroblasts, linker H1 between nucleosomes
- HMGA1 dependant conversion to ES cell like state (removal of linker)
- EITHER :: Chromosome regulated
- OR, UPON FAILURE :: Aberrant transcription, hence cancer

- During oncogene induced senescence, must reorganise chromatin
- Mass opening of chromatin to form NFRs and an ES cell like state
- HMGA1 crucial to opening and 3D condensations
- HMGA1 -> enhancosomes for IFN\beta
