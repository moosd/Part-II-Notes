* Intro
 - What are the limitations of differet techniques
 - Fractionate tissues, purify out using antibodies
 - gene level to protein level integration

* Fractionation - Magnetic separation
 - Magetic beads coupled to monoclonal Abs
 - Or streptavidin (binds to biotin moieties)
 - Paramagnetic column, matrix of conducting material with spaces for cells
 - Many spaces mean many chances for cells to interact with magnetised matrix and stick around

 - Good :: SCALABLE - can sort many more cells by making column longer but takes same time.
 - Bad :: Purity not as good as fluorescence

** Positive selection
 - Antibodies against protein of interest
 - Bad :: This may activate receptor, altering biology of cell
 - Good :: 90-95% efficiency
** Negative selection
 - Antibodies against everything else but protein of interest
 - Good :: Wont activate any receptors
 - Bad :: Need antibodies against everything else, always less effective than positive selection

* Fractionation - fluorescence cell sorting
 - Bad :: Not scalable - time increases with number of cells needed to sort
 - Hydrodynamic focussing - cells into fast flowing fluid, whose hydrodynamic properties separate the cells
 - Measure light scattered
 - PMT = photomultiplier tubes
 - more colours used - more work (emission spectra overlap)
 - create compensation matrix in software
 - measure FITC value, subtract ~27% of this value from value recorded from PE signal, for example
** Fluoresence Resonance Energy Transfer
 - Chemically couple PE to another dye, electron transfer to other dye through electron resonance
 - PE photon not produced - different wavelength made instead by this new resonant system
 - Shifts spectrum of fluorophore
 - (Practical Flow Cytometry, Howard Shapiro, 2003)
 - (First Flow Principles, Alice Given, 2001)
** More cytometry
 - Bad :: Compensation increases noise
 - Nozzle vibrated at high frequency to create droplets
 - Can vary intensity of charge
 - Droplets given different charges based on different laser readings
 - Droplets deflected differentially by charged plate (electrostatic)
 - Potentially 6 populations from one input!
 - Using same fluoresence protein in antibodies for selecting against traits in negative selection (saves no of fluorescent proteins available to use)
 - Fluorescence instruments just to categorise
   + Immunophenotyping (based on optical properties from Abs and lasers)
   + Low angle scatter, roughly proportional to size of cells
 - Isoforms from alternative splicing, only had one expressed - trans gene, not much control over expression
 - Immunophenotyping analysis may be tricky!
 - Retracted study claimed FOXP3+ cells that were not T cells
 - Actually, some cells were binding Fc of Ab instead of binding to FOXP3 - hence this result
 - Can be difficult to separate two different populations, dont always get good separation

* Cytof
 - Cytometry by time of flight
 - Antibodies with heavy metals (e.g. isotopes of Lanthanum)
 - Add to cells, allow to bind Abs
 - nebulise cells
 - Fried and ions analysed using time of flight - looks at mass/charge ratio, but same charge ions = looking at mass
 - HIgh dimensional multiparameter analysis
 - Good :: Many more dimensions
 - Bad :: 32 markers means potentially 2^32 populations! Must use computerised clustering algorithms
 - SPADE analysis

** Example of use
 - Are variations in human immune cells driven by genetics or environment?
 - Compare MZ twins vs DZ twins
 - Majority of immune cell populations - no genetic influence
 - A few with heritable environment
 - CD27+ heritable
 - No explanation given why

** Caveat
 - Another group (Roederer et al, 2015) just three months later with conventional tools got exactly same results and more
 - Elucidated reasons
 - Heritability was due to expression levels, not more cells
