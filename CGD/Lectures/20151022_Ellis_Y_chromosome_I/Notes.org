#+TITLE Sex and the single Y: The rock'n'roll chromosome?
#+AUTHOR Dr Peter Ellis, University of Kent
#+DATE Thu 22 Oct, 2015

* Slide 1
 - Molecular genomics and structure to functional stuff
 - Function of Y chromosome has profound impact on structure
 - Structure as consequence of function
 - Structure in turn influences which functions accumulate on them
 - Not as simple as X chromosome female, Y male

* Slide 2, 3, 4
 - No notes taken

* Slide 5
 - Plants have both male and female!

* Slide 6
 - Drosophila XY male but sex is dosage dependant not Y dependant

* Slide 7
 - cell positive feedback - Sox9 transcription factor activates itself
 - Autocrine - Fgf9 and Fgf receptor
 - Paracrine via Prostaglandin D2
 - Negative feedback leads to stabilising feedback
 - Positive feedback leads to switching behaviour, nowhere in between
 - Organ makes an executive decision as a whole to be one or other

* Slide 8
 - Look at evolutionarily conserved bits and pieces
 - Male module, self reinforcing
 - Female module, self reinforcing
 - Each represses other
 - Sox9, Fgf9 all conserved
 - Allows for choice - then choice reinforced by network
 - Activating any one gene activates all others
 - Oestrogen receptors can be temperature sensitive - alligators! Below temperature, do signal!
 - Originally, environmental/social factors to determine sex
 - Superceded by genetic switch to force the choice, becomes in Y chromosome
 - Global warming/cooling -> would affect number of males/females -> selection pressure to make genetic force

* Slide 9
 - Like jump starting a car - short circuits to skip choosing process, flips module on
 - Dominant negative - inactivates one module
 - Dmrt1 and Foxl2 important for maintaining differentiation, else can use tetracycline inducible factors to transdifferentiate

* Slide 10
 - No notes taken

* Slide 11
 - Small regions are homologous to allow for pairing and segregation during cell division, else apoptosis
 - Y degenerates because it forces the switch

* Slide 12, 13, 14
 - No notes taken

* Slide 15
 - Two autosomes per person
 - Half Y per person
 - 1.5 X per person
 - Hence, much smaller population
 - So much more vulnerable to genetic drift
 - Efficiency of selection is low
 - Random factor much higher
 - Deleterious mutations more likely

* Slide 16
 - Stochastic loss of undamaged chromosome once recombination can no longer happen
** Muller's Ratchet
 - Rate of mutation > rate of selection
 - Smaller population relative to autosomes
 - every Y chromosome gets some sort of damage
 - So eventually we lose the pure undamaged haplotype from population
 - Autosomal genes can recombine to fix this, get one with no mutations, one with two, deleterious combination selected against - not the case in Y!

** Background selection
 - If high background deleterious mutation rate, one beneficial mutation may not give enough of a fitness advantage to stay!
 - Doesnt happen in autosomes because recombination can rescue beneficial mutation into a clean background
 - Doomed on Y chromosome
 - Hence, few beneficial mutations accumulate

** Hitchhiking
 - A very beneficial mutation can drag along with it all the deleterious background mutations that have accumulated with it
 - Pulled to fixation with other bad mutations

** Eventually
 - Deleterious mutations accumulate over time, eventually deleted
 - Hence, Y chromosome shrinks!
 - All to do with lack of recombination
 - Parasitic genomic elements, e.g. LINEs, SINEs, retroviral elements can all build up on Y

* Slide 17
 - Global warming/cooling -> imbalance in gender -> selection pressure to evolve more of other gender by forcing it
 - Chromosomal inversions = lead to lack of recombination
 - Why suppress recombination?
 - Antagonistic selection - genes that confer benefit to one gender but not other
 - Gene may be deleterious to females but beneficial to males
 - Differential fitness benefits - want to preserve good linkage between maleness gene and male sperm motility/punch lion in face gene
 - Interest to preserve favourable linkages

* Slide 18, 19
 - No notes taken

* Slide 20
 - To not break up favourable combination of alleles - good placenta genes not on Y chromosome!

* Slide 21
 - All other genes not relevant to gender-based advantages undergo degeration because of the lack of recombination!
 - Lost! Y shrinks
 - Only genes beneficial to males or deleterious to females kept on Y chromosome

* Slide 22
 - When non recombining chromosome, build up on LINEs and SINEs
 - Drosophila, neo-Y - begun to degenerate but hasnt to same extent yet

* Slide 23
 - Jenny Graves articles very weird
 - Some species have lost it completely - hence, dose dependance on number of X chromosomes?
 - But not necessarily

* Slide 24
 - PAR :: pseudoautosomal region
 - Pairing region retained
 - Gene traffic between X and Y here

* Slide 25
 - If 4-5 copes, mutation in 1 leads to little difference

* Slide 26
 - Strata of degree of similarity
 - Some recent papers - up to 11?

* Slide 27
 - XAR :: X added region - present in placental mammals but not marsupials
 - XCR :: X conserved region
 - Iterative process, gradual addition and attrition of segments

* Slide 28
 - Y enriched for spermatogenesis genes
 - Layer cake effect

* Slide 29
 - Stochastic processes involved - hence different species retain different genes
 - Sry conserved because thats the point of the Y chromosome...

* Slide 30
 - X transposed - transposed to X recently in human lineage

* Slide 31
 - No notes taken

* Slide 32
 - X chromosome more conserved than autosomes
 - Some law? Ernols?

* Slide 33
 - No notes taken

* Slide 34
 - Comparison of syntenic sequences
 - Autosomes traffic lots of genes between them
 - X conserved

* Slide 35
 - Genetic sex determination - solved
 - Sex chromosomes to link advantageous alleles - solved
 - Now, with one copy in males and two copies in females - gene dosage issue
 - Humans, one X does work of two autosomes

* Slide 36
 - Xp = paternal
 - Xm = maternal
 - Lots of ways to achieve it, marsupials have it imprinted

* Slide 37
 - As X and Y diverge, X and autosomes shut down traffic - impacts dosage
 - LINEs spread X inactivation

* Slide 38
 - PAR - everyone has two copies of it anyway, so no inactivation here

* Slide 39
 - Zfx and Zfy
 - Zfx escapes X inactivation, one present on each chromosome
 - Mouse, Zfx inactivated, Zfy expressed only in testes, male specific
 - Xic on q arm
 - Centromere messes with inactivation
 - Hence Xp arm leaky inactivation
 - So difference between XO and XX

* Slide 40, 41, 42
 - No notes taken

* Slide 43
 - Dispermy - absolute gene dosage matters

* Slide 44, 45
 - No notes taken

* Slide 46
 - Fertility issues because cant line up in meiosis!

* Slide 47, 48, 49, 50
 - No notes taken

* Slide 51
 - Translocations because Sry is close to autosomal region, edge of Y terminus
 - If recombination in PAR, chiasma slip slightly further down, Sry moved
 - Most species have it far away from PAR boundaries

* Slide 52
 - Calves bigger paradoxically, because they are working harder to keep body up

* Slide 53
 - Silencing may spread to autosomal region
 - These die off because autosomal bits silenced
 - Only ones that make other choice survive, hence inactivation skew
 - Hence, normal copy is inactivated

* Slide 54, 55, 56
 - No notes taken
