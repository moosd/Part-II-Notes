#+TITLE Cancer phenotypes: interogating by genetics and drugs
#+AUTHOR Edinburgh CRUK

* Intro
- FAK function - scaffolding, polarisation and invasion
- Focal Adhesion Kinase
- TUmour immune evasion
- Imaging cancer phenotypes in vivo

* Src
- Src (Rous sarcoma) - tyrosine kinases and cancer - lot of history
- Src has a number of substrates, one is FAK
- Drug targets :: kinase oncoproteins
- cancer drivers - what are they driving?
- Is inhibiting a kinase activity a good thing if they are molecular scaffolds?

* Initial signalling
- Growth factor receptors -> cSrc phosphorylates FAK (next to integrin dimers)
- -> Adhesion dynamics -> cell migration, growth + survival

* Involved in cancer?
- Conditional flox alleles (LoxP sites)
- (Lahou et al, PNAS, 2011)
- (Ashton et al, 2010)
- (McLean et al, 2004)
- in skin, breast, intestine, prostate - FAK knockoput impairs PROGRESSION
- Could not progress to malignant phenotype
- No of regenerating crypts -> no FAK
- But required for tissue homeostasis, recovery after DNA damage

* Functional integration between Wnt and integrin pathways through FAK
- Mutate APC to induce cancer

- E-cadherin <-> \beta-cadherin ---(Apc ko) --> nuclear \beta catenin -> Myc
- Myc -> FAK <-> \beta 1, \beta 3 integrins
- Skin - squamous cell carcinoma?

* FAK activation
- (Frame et al, Nature Review Mol Cell Biol, 2010)
- FAK binds transcription factors in a kinase dependant manner
- e.g. Runx1

- Mutant FAK impairs FAK-FERM-RACK1
- Cant then polarise cell
- If space made in monolayer, staining Golgi, FAK causes cells to turn towards it
- Actin regulation
- FAK mutation - impairment in ability to turn to stimulus

- Parenteral can migrate to ECF/serum
- FAK -/- cannot
- (Serrels et al, 2010)

- Building nuclear complexes
- RACK1, Arp2/3, Eps8

* FAK is involved in
- Actin assembly
- Cell polarisation
- Directional migration
- Chemotactic cancer cell invasion
- Drives invasion and metastasis?

* Stress activator
- David Shlaepfer - stress signals activate FAK
- Also oncogenic stress? Elevated FAK in nucleus
- Binds p53
- FERM domain needed to translocate to nucleus

* Angiogenesis and inflammation - genes regulated by FAK
- FAK -/- cells injected for primary immune response
- Challenged with wt cells
- Memory retained, wt cells do not grow after challenge
- (Serrels and Lund, 2015?)
- FAK expressed, T cell exhaustion phenotype seen

* How does FAK cause an immunosuppressive environment?
- Increase in Tregs
- Does depletion of CD25+ cells (Tregs) help?
- Results in ceels behaving like FAK deficient tumor cells
- So FAK somehow induces Treg formation
- Hence why CD4+ depletion leads to tumour clearance
- Tregs keep Tc cells at bay, FAK manner
- Hence CD8:Treg ration good marker of outcome

* FAK increases recruitment/induction of Tregs - how?
- FAK upregulates chemokine receptors
- Expression of cognate receptors seen to increase in tumour infiltrating Tregs
- CCL5 knockdown -> key player in regulating Treg influx

* Mechanism
- FAK -> nuclear FAK mediates CCL5 transcription and immune evasion
- verastem FAK inhibitor - VS4718
- (or block CCL5?)
- effector CD8:Treg ratio - prognostic marker for tumour outcome

* FAK regulates tumour environment
- constraining T cell mediated anti-tumour response
- Serendipidy :: FAK kinase inhibitors act as immunomodulatory agents

* Surprises
- FAK controls chemokine transcription
- Clinically relevant FAK kinase inhibitors -> clearance
- FAK scaffolding transcriptionally regulates complexes on chromatin
- FAK -> solidifies at membrane precipitation, hence misinterpretation of images showing foci?

* Summary
- Actin polymerisation, cell spreading
- Adhesion, migration, invasion
- Survival response to stress

* Questions
- Src tethered by FAK
- w/o FAK, Src toxic, removed by autophagy
- FAK block - block angiogenesis as major effect?

* Imaging
- Raman (CARS) - label free imaging
- 2 photon (2P-EF) imaging
- (Chau et al, 2014)
- Label free intravital imaging - (Brunton and Lee)
- Breast cancer to ensure removal of tumour cells
- Drug imaging to make sure drug is reaching target
