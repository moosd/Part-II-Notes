* Intro
    - Immune response requires comunication
        - Developmental specialisation
        - Cell-to-cell contact directly
        - Direct pattern recognition of bacterial products with pathogen
        - Soluble mediators they produce - antibodies, complement, cytokines
    - Cytokines important way that innate and adaptive response communicate
      with each other
    - Cyto = cell, kine = movement, molecules that cause cell movement
    - Secreted from cell to ECM
    - Signalling molecules
    - Self signalling -> Autocrine, neughbouring cell -> paracrine, into
      circulation, systemic effect -> endocrine

* Pathways
    - Redundancy, multiple effects via different mechanisms
    - Evolutionary :: More difficult for pathogens to disrupt signalling
    - PLEIOTROPY - one cytokine differrent effects in different cells
    - REDUNDANCY - Multiple cytokines, same effect
    - ANTAGONISM - One cytokine can block the activity of another (IFN\gamma
      vs IL4)
    - CASCADE INDUCTION - release of one cytokine has effect on lymphocyte to
      cause differentiation, causes waves of more production of same and
      different cytokines.

* Chemokines
    - Chemokine even more redundant
    - Cytokines - one cytokine binds to one receptor
    - Each chemokine can be recognised by multiple receptors and each cell
      can express more than one receptor
    - Each receptor can bind other chemokines
    - Are examples of faithful receptor interaction but few and far between
      (CCL17 -> CCR4 [which can bind CCL22])
    - chemokines operate much more redundantly
    - Evolutionary :: Stronger selection pressure for redundancy (following
      bacteria around to phagocytose it?)

* Classification
    - Structural
        - Type I cytokines = contain four alpha helical bindle structure
        - Type II cytokines
    - Expression/broad function
        - Interleukins (IL) = between leukocytes, thought that mainly
          produced by T cells but can be made by epithelial cells, etc - 37
          ILs known
        - Tumour Necrosis Factors (TNFs) = antitumour effects after bacterial
          infection, released as part of innate repsonse, 19 members
        - Interferons - Intefere with viral infection (17 family members)
        - Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) - anti proliferative factors, 33
          members of family
    - Chemokines :: Chemo-tactic cyto-kines, cause a change in movement down
      a chemical gradient, 20-50% sequency similarity, much smaller
      (8-10kDa). Rich in beta sheets in structure
        - CC chemokines
        - CXC chemokines
        - XC chemokines
        - CX3C chemokines

* Immune disease
    - Must differentiate self vs non self (Burnet) and threatening vs non
      threatening (Matzinger)
    - Failure of self vs non self -> Autoimmunity, different diseases driven
      by different cytokine release profiles
    - Failure of threatening vs non threatening, allergy -> ragweed pollen
    - Diseases of MISCORRELATION
    - IL2 gamma chain gene mutation - no signalling from cytokines affected,
      key in B and T cells development - X-linked SCID

* Development
    - Homeostasis and haematopoiesis

* Evolution
    - Evolved in fish
    - Guo P, Cooper MD 2009
    - Cytokines co-evolved with adaptive immunity, how cells stay in contact

* Studying function
    - Deficient mice
    - Trea wt mice with recombinant cytokine protein
    - Knock in
    - Deletions
    - Making cytokine deficient mice
        - Modify gene of interest and transfect into bacteria capable of
          homologous recombination
        - Transfect into mouse ES cells and select
        - Inject GM ES cells into mouse blastocysts and implant
        - Assay resulting mouse line for cDNA and protein expression
    - Issues - whats if ko causes death, what if want to look at only in
      certain tissues
        - cre LoxP

* Use it to define immune populations
    - Coffman first to define T cells by function not what they express on
      cell surface (based on cytokine profiles)
    - Th2 cell clones prod b cells to make IgE but not Th1 cell clones

* Funcitonal networks produce specific immune responses
    - Type I response for M tuberculosis to form granuloma to wall off
      bacteria
    - Without this differentiation event of macrophage, M tuberculosis takes
      over and organism dies

* Helminthic parasites
    - In the US, 4000 people die of asthma a year
    - type II evolved to remove parasites from gut, mucus produced by
      intestine (weep), muscle contraction - "sweep"
    - Weep and sweep - parasites cant attach and contracts to push parasites
      out of system
    - Many ILs involved (see slides)
    - Assthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, inappropriate type 2 response
      occuring in lungs rather than gut,
