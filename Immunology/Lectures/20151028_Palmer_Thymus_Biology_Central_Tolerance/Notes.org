* Lunchtime seminar
 - T cells follow collagen lines
 - Around tumour, collagen laid down in concentric rings
 - Hence, Tc cells circle tumour and dont kill anything

* Features and functions of a T cell
 - Essential to express a receptor on surface (TCR)
 - TCR must recognise MHC molecules (MHC restriction)

 - TCR -> \beta chain -> VDJ
 - TCR \alpha chain - VJ only
 - T cell involves recombination of receptor, Nobel Prize for going against Beadle and Tatum's one gene one enzyme hypothesis

 - Two broad clones of T cells
 - CD8+ binding to MHC class I
 - CD4+ binding to MHC class II

* What does a stem cell need to go through to be a T cell?
 - Stem cell has germline configuration
 - Recombination -> triggered by thymus
 - Potential malignancy with messing with genome, hence must be ordered
 - When T cells leave thymus, they are MHC restricted

 - Functional mature T cells must be self tolerant
 - Lineage commitment
 - Repertoire selection (education)
 - Functional maturation

 - T cells educated by thymus
 - Stem cells pluripotent, migrate to thymus, progress to T cell lineage, unlike earlier ideas

 - Secondary lymphoid organs around areas where likely to be infection
   + Peyers patches in gut

 - Microenvironment - heterogeneous group of cells
 - Subcapsular epithelium
 - Cortical epithelium
 - Medullary epithelium - tolerance induction

* THYMOPOIESIS

 - IL7 production
 - Delete/disrupt cell types in microenvironment, delete/disrupt T cell development
 - Foxn1 = nude mouse
 - Lacks hair/thymus
 - Stem cells not instructed to differentiate

* Process
 - Double negative --- Checkpoint (\beta-selection) ---> Double positive ----- positive/negative selection, repertoire selection/functional maturation --> Single positive

* Ratios
 - CD4/CD8 ratio normally ~2:1
 - HIV skews ratio to 0.8:1 when severely ill

 - \gamma\delta T cells made into thymus, represent first line of defence
 - IEL lymphocytes
 - Skin, gut
 - Much less restricted, non classical restriction via CD1(a,b,c,d) - recognises bacterial products

 - Receptor gene rearrangement is important
 - No expressing \alpha and \beta chain = no progression
 - \beta chain rearranged first

 - DN1 -> DN2 -> DN3 -> DP cells
 - IL7 - produced by stromal cells
 - Cause rearrangement of TCR\beta and production of RAG1/2 (recombinase activation gene)

 - D-J rearranged
 - V-DJ rearranged
 - Expresses \beta chain
 - Heterodimer, needs both parts to get to cell surface
 - MHC, many other immune molecules too
 - pre-T\alpha chain (pre-T cell receptor)
 - Surrogate \alpha chain with functional \beta chain

 - flanking regions of VDJ allow enzymes to bind
 - Arabian foal - DNA kinase k/o = fail to rearrange receptor, immunocompromised
 - DN1/2 = pluripotent
 - DN3 = CD25 expression = commitment to T cell lineage

 - pre TCR signalling terminates recombination, allelic exclusion
 - ZAP70 -> SLP76 = allelic exclusion
 - IL7/IL7R mutation -> X linked SCID
 - RAG1/2 mutation -> Omenn syndrome

 - To get to first checkpoint, must get to pre T cell receptor
 - IL7 receptor -> common \gamma chain to other receptors
 - IL2,4,27,9,15
 - Lack common chain, none of the above receptors expressed (since they must be heterodimers to get to cell surface membrane)
 - Hence, cell unresponsive to cytokines

 - IL7 -> survival dactor, induces RAG1/2
 - Produced by thymic stroma

* Notch signalling
 - Jagged or Delta, expressed in thymus
 - Knockout, embryonic lethal because used in development
 - Mouse, day 14 -> thymus development (~6mnths equivalent in humans)
 - Mouse gestation around 21 days
 - Need tissue knockout in thymus (Radke F et al, 1999)
 - Numbers of thymocytes low, T cell development blocked
 - Mostly all B cells!

** Model
 - Stem cells migrate into the thymus, predetermined to be T cells? No! Pluripotent! Thymus skews them to T cell lineage!
 - Notch and so on important in cell fate determination
 - Why thymus not bone marrow?
 - Active Notch -> T cells
 - No Notch -> B cells
 - Notch into bone marrow -> T cells produced!

* Microenvironment
 - (Takahama et al, 2006)
 - (Blackburn et al, 2002)
 - Thymus - endocrine gland, develops separately from third pharyngeal arch, T cells then migrate into it
 - IL7 - MUST come from thymic epithelium - must be through Notch and other proteins
 - thymic stem cells + nonTEC experiments

* Thymic cross talk
 - thymocytes impact microenvironment
 - Cortical and medullary cells not differentiated
 - If block T cells at different stages at their development, different organisations seen
 - Only DN1 cells -> oTEC, mTEC present, disorganised
 - Lacking SP cells, no medulla

* Short summary
 - T (and B) lymphocytes express antigenic receptor
 - Each cell expresses different clone
 - TCR + Ig made from gene segments
 - Diversity achieved - antigen independant
 - Somatic hypermutation only in B cells
 - T and B cells follow complex and regulated patern of development
 - Microenvironment
 - \gamma\delta T cells have their own separate VJC segments to rearrange from
 - (end of first lecture)

* Central tolerance
 - pre T cell receptor triggers \alpha gene rearrangement
 - Surrogate light chain decreased
 - \alpha:\beta TCR produced
 - Decision is made - express TCR
 - Selected CD4 or CD8
 - Driver is TCR itself

 - Expansion of double positives establish a wide repertoire for selection
 - Interaction between TCR and MHC
 - Fails to bind -> die by neglect
 - Binds too strongly -> die by apoptosis
 - Selection for "appropriate" interaction
 - Tregs develop in thymus, receptor binding stronger than +ve, slightly weaker than -ve
 - Given all thymocytes destined to die, only cells responding appropriately survive
 - DIverse TCR because MHC are diverse
 - Speed dating, no interaction/too much interaction

* Evolutionary
 - Parallel between diversity of MHC and TCR repertoire during development
 - Debate :: TCR strength of signal or conformational change? Both?

* Models for selection process
 - Instruction model :: TCR binding to MHC class I instructed to be CD8+, downregulate CD4
 - Stochastic/selective model :: cells that downregulate randomly, those that match survive
 - TCR transgenics - certain TCR specificity, used to look at process of development
 - Expressed at different times - somewhat artificial - expressed during DN phase for example
 - Strength of signal model :: TCR binds to MHC, signal strength appropriate, positive lymphocyte selection
 - Positive selection is driven by the MHC

 - Irradiated to allow donor bone marrow to stay
 - Skin cells have ability to be regulated to either
 - Only select T cells restricted to host -> thymus

* Minor histocompatibility
 - Major histocompatibility from tissue grafts on burns victims in WW2
 - Minor, only difference is on Y chromosome
 - Rejecting male skin
 - Transgenic mice with CD8 clone. T cell receptor deleted, negative selection
 - When TCR expressed, endogenous TCRs dont rearrange because of allelic exclusion
   + monoclonal mouse!
 - T cell receptor transgenics against liver proteins
 - Deleted
 - Thymus expresses uniquely genes from lots of tissues - promiscuous gene expression
 - In MEDULLA
 - (Derbinski J et al, 2001)

 - +ve selection in cortex, CCR7 up to drag cells to medulla
 - -ve selection in medulla

 - (Kristen A et al, 2005)
 - survival signal depleted
 - Fail to undergo negative selection -> autoimmune disease
 - LT\beta, TRAF6, MK-REL-B knockout leads to this
 - AIRE responsible for promiscuous gene expression
 - Dendritic cells => negative selection contribution through their cross presentation

 - AIRE -> histone 3 -> DNA methylation modulation
 - Also epithelial cells lacking AIRE undergo tolerance induction - so AIRE not be all and end all
 - But AIRE plays important role
 - Central tolerance also -> Treg production - (Seddon B et al, 2010)
 - Thymectomy - 3-6weeks = autoimmunity, 10weeks = no autoimmune disease
 - Selected (Hseih C-Y et al, 2012)
 - FoxP3 deletion -> IPEX -> disease APECED

* Age induced thymic involution
 - Different from thymic atrophy, which happens in e.g. T cruzi, deliberately damaging thymus, or stress involution (reversible)
 - Universal feature in all species
 - Aged thymus -> reduce in size, disintegration, decreased T cell output
 - No of cells dont change in periphery. But shift from naive to memory cells
 - Thymopoiesis defective
 - Homeostatic proliferation, occupy space, expand accordingly
 - Repertoire different, more restricted
 - If common antigen, e.g. tetanus, can respond
 - If new antigen, e.g. changing virus, lacking receptor to fight it off
 - (Vallejo AN, 2007)

 - telomere shortening of memory cells with more cell division
 - Aged individuals, more T cells lack CD28 (no costimulation)
 - Cant proliferate, NK like phenotype
 - Immune senescence, mortality highest in oldest population for influenza outbreak, for example
 - Involution of thymus as catalyst?
 - Calorie restriction -> delay in involution, slightly healthier

** Thymus disappears at puberty? 
 - Castrate male mice, increase in thymocytes
 - Stars decreasing, doesnt manifest effects until later life?
 - Not a straight line of involution - at least biphasic!
