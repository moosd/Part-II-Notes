  Describe the signalling mechanisms by which DNA is detected by
  inflammasomes and how the products of inflammasome activation regulate the
  host response to viral infection

** Intro
    - Intro to innate and danger hypothesis
    - Why DNA is detected
    - Where the DNA might come from - parasites, bacteria, viruses, own
      cells, what might stop it from being detected
    - DNA degradation products as proxy for DNA - uric acid

    - What is the inflammasome
    - How was it discovered? How is it investigated?
** Detection
    - Initial receptors for these ligands - DNA-PK, cGAS, STING, AIM, cytoplasmic vs
      TLRs
        - Evidence
        - experiments
** Signal transduction
    - Secondary messengers, domains and conformational changes
        - evidence and experiments
** Assembly of inflammasome
    - Assembly of inflammasomes - canonical, non canonical
        - different types, different expts
** Result of inflammasome, e.g. with viral infection
    - How it works
        - outputs
    - Output to control inflammasomes
    - Possible outcomes in viral infection - ISGs, etc
    - pathogens using it like m tuberculosis actively secreting dna
** Aberrant activation
    - What happens when it goes wrong?
