* Aim of B cells
 - B cell terminally differentiated upon stimulation with antigen
 - Loses BCR expression, produces soluble antibody
 - Antibody production is the goal

* Signalling
 - BCR no signalling capacity of itself
 - Have to associate with Ig\alpha (CD79a) and Ig\beta (CD79b) for signalling
 - These have ITAM domains (immunotyrosine activation motif)
 - Allows them to recruit some kinases and propagate signal - esp Syk -> PI3K -> PIP3
 - Drives various transcriptional factors

* Additional signals modulate B cell activation threshold
 - Can recognise de novo antigen - no need to be chopped up and put up on MHC
 - Hence much easier to trigger than T cells, and can be slightly promiscuous
 - Difficulties for autoreactive
 - Hence expresses CD19, CD21 (ComplementR2) (co-receptors) - ligated, then can active PI3K
 - Lowers activation threshold
 - Gives context - seeing antigen AND complement activated = probably trouble
 - Self antigen? Probably complement not activated, hence protects
 - TLRs

* BAFF
 - BAFF-R (B cell Activating Factor of the TNF family) (also BLISS - B Lymphocyte Stimulator)/BCMA
 - BAFF binds to two receptors and promotes survival and activation of B cells
 - Made a mouse overexpressing BAFF - way too many B cells in spleen
 - Version of mouse lacking T cells too - see same thing
 - Give B cells enough of T cells, by giving BAFF, can get rid of T cell help
 - Autoimmune diseases with higher levels of BAFF -> more B cells activated perhaps inappropriately

 - T cells express CD40L, CD40 also another signal

 - Paradigm :: WHERE THERE IS AN ON SWITCH, MUST HAVE AN OFF SWITCH
 - Fc\gammaRIIB - if antigen bound to IgG (immune complex), can cross link complex to 
 - has ITIM in cytoplasmic domain (can recruit phosphatases to switch off signalling)
 - Can cause B cell death to get rid of autoreactive B cells
 - Dont want B cell to keep going on and on and making antibody
 - Important for terminating antibody responses

 - Antigen recognition - antigen via BCR doesnt necessarily mean it will be activated - context in which it is engaging antigen - danger signals, complement activation, or inhibitory, etc

* B cell response to Ag takes place in secondary lymphoid organs

* How do B cells get access to antigen?
** Conduit system (core of collagen fibre surrounded by ECM proteins)
 - Core, can transport small antigens < 70kDa
 - Small antigens subcutaneous, can get into B cell follicles this way - efficient way of distributing antigen
** Via subcapsular sinus macrophages
 - The flypaper of lymph node - anything coming in through lymphatic fluid
 - Important in response to viral infections
 - vsv - vesicular stomatatis virus
 - normally, short wavelength gets scattered in short distances - can only see up to 10microns
 - long wavelength - 2 photon microscopy - can look in real time at live animals
 - Subcapsular Sinus macrophages allow B cells to access viral antigen and immune complexes
 - B cells can actually shuttle antigens from scs to follicular dendritic cells (by complement receptor)l

** From dendritic cells
 - High endothelial venules (from blood to lymph node)
 - Resident dendritic cells waving arms around
 - migratory DCs - come in from tissues
 - Position themelves next to high endothelial venule
 - Make model mouse where all B cells only recognise one model antigen - HEL
 - In lymph nodes, number of efficient ways to get access to antigen

** Via marginal zone in spleen
 - Marginal zone B cells - can pick up antigen and migrate to follicle
 - Mice, injected Iv with antigen can stain in blue colour
 - Mouse with B cells lacking CXCR5 receptor, no more migration - B cells responsible for shuttling of antigen

* T-dependant antibody responses
 - Tymus dependant
 - athymic mice (mutation in ribosomal protein SA or 22q11 deletion)
 - Sort of antigens must be protein antigens
 - Cognate interaction between T cells and B cells (relationship between what is recognised by both)

 - Pre-T follicular helper cells - fate becomes to live in follicles
 - B cell gets such help, two possible outcomes
 - Plasmoblast (short lived) - in extracellular space, making lots of antibody quickly - rapid antibody response
 - Second fate -> Germinal centre response, back into follicle, somatic hypermutation and class switching
 - -> Higher affinity, long lived plasma cells

 - Summary four outputs from a TD response

** Plasmablasts in the extrafollicular foci
 - Formation of EF plasmablasts also need T cell help
 - using HEL with medium affinity (switch HEL mice)
 - T cells lacking factor Bcl6 (key factor for differentiation of Tfh)

** Germinal Centre B cells
 - Exciting, higher affinity receptor
 - Interaction at T-B border required
 - Make a competition - which of T cells will interact with B cells, look at interaction times
 - wild type -> long interaction
 - SAP knockouts - rubbish interactions, doesnt let them properly activate B cells - negligible GC formation
 - somatic hypermutation - AID
 - New affinity, must now test if better.
 - FDC sequester antigen to allow BCR testing
 - FDC is a stromal cell - dendrites hence dendritic cells - antigen bank
 - No FDC -> GC response compromised
 - B cells then compete against each other for T cell help
 - Interaction - contact dependant and cytokine help for B cell
 - Deliver antigen by DEC205, an force internalisation of antigen without BCR
 - With antigen, have preferential access to T cell help, and so expand and form more of germinal centre
 - IL21 - KEY
 - Generated by Tfh
 - Can use it therapeutically - may try blocking this cytokine
 - From light zone back to dark zone (more H&E stain - B cells dividing)
 - new BCR
 - Goes back to light zone to test antibodies
 - Round and round
 - Affinity maturation requires death
 - transcriptomics to show dark zone B cells -> cell cycle genes upregulated

** Memory B cells (GC)
 - Long lived, lower activatory threshold due to much higher affinity
 - Phenomenon of vaccination

** Long term antibody (Bone marrow derived plasma cells)
 - Need to get back to their niche
 - Need to adapt for long lifetime
 - Germinal centre exit cells, about 10% finds home in bone marrow niche
 - CXCR4 upregulated, responds to CXCL12 made by bone marrow
 - Limited niche - competition
 - Get immunised, pushed out old plasma cells otherwise they'd build up and up!
 - Initially thought bone marrow stromal cells made all these factors, but recently shown other cells (neutrophils, eosinophils,etc) make some of these factors
 - Immunise mice lacking eosinophils -> Much lower levels of APRIL and much lower number of BM plasma cells
** Long life
 - Transcription factor is BLIMP1 encoded by prdm1
 - Role (or one of) is to transcribe genes like XBP1 (ER stress control)
 - Plasma cell is protein factory
 - This might be hazardous - misfolded protein risk high
 - XBP ko -> far fewer plasma cells surviving
 - Plasma cells sensitive to build up of misfolded proten
 - Proteosome (get rid of misfolded proteins) inhibitor (bortezomib) -> used in multiple myeloma (malignancy of plasma cells)
 - Interest in transplantation
 - Use bortezimib - destroy antiHLA Abs that destroy allografts
