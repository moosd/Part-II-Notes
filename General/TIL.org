  discovery of viruses by Pierre-Paul Emile Roux

  Livor mortis :: Acumulation of blood on lower part of body, separating from
  serum, leaking through capillaries that have necrosed and so have increased
  in permeability

  Algor mortis :: acclimatisation of body to ambient temperature, time of
  death estimated wusing *Glaister equation*

  Tsetse fly : Glossina

  Thelazia :: Nemotode worm parasite spread by Diptera (flies) that
  literally feed on your tears. And the parasite lives in eyelids, tear
  ducts, tear glands, occasionally in eyeball, either under conjunctiva or in
  vitreous cavity

  Loa loa :: Nemotode worm causing filariasis (Calabar swellings under skin,
  or African eyeworm). Humans contract it through bite of Mango fly (Chrysops
  species) or Deer fly

  HERC2 OCA2 for iris colour - mutation in HERC2 leads to skipping of
  downstream OCA2 -> blue eyes

  Dracunuliasis :: Guinea worm

  CIPA fixed by opioid antagonist (NaV1.7)

  Disulfiram (antabuse) kicks out HIV from latent state

  YME1 controls number, type and shape of mitochondria in cell, deficiency
