* Main gist
- (At cafe synthetique)
- Gut folding must be smooth, if you were to shove it into the body, would have kinks - not good for food absorption!
- How is it achieved?
- Mesenteric fascia contracts, gut grows faster
- Forms perversions and classical architecture
- Latex sheet stretched, attached to rubber tube

- Then latex sheet allowed to contract, forms same patterns
- Formed model using youngs modulus, etc
- Measured parameters from guts using magnet, steel ball superglued to fascia, or inside gut, other held pinned down.
- Magnet used for force, camera to measure distance
