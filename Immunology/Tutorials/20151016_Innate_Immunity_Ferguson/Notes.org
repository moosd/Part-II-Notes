* Innate immunity impact on adaptive immunity
- Initial sensor, localisation
- Drives type of response
- ADCC
- APCs = captures and presents material
- w/o innate -> tolerisation
- Adaptive uses innate as effector

* Molecular systems
- What is it?
- How does it work?
- What happens when it goes wrong?

* Innate thoughts
- Problem: Almost fixed genome vs evolving genome
- Adaptive immunity = evolution on steroids to reach a stalemate
- Memory, protection against same pathogen

* PAMPs and DAMPs
- DAMPs can mean presence of pathogen that has distuirbed host

* Pro-inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory?
- HOMEOSTASIS
- We live in the midst of explosive devices; we are mined - Lewis Thomas
