* Intro
 - Intracellular detection of nucleic acids
 - Many PAMPs in a virus, but the detection of genomes themselves in crucial
 - Genomes must be exposed to the cell in order to replicate
 - Cannot evolve away from DNA and RNA!
 - Investigate:
   + How they are sensed and recognised?
   + How they are responded to?
   + Mechanisms on a molecular level?

* Innate responses to DNA
 - Investigate using Vaccinia, unusual because it is a DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm
 - Cytoplasm, should not be any DNA there! Sensing to trigger alarm
 - *APPROPRIATE LOCALISATION* important for particular molecules

* Not just viruses
 - Bacteria, e.g. Listeria monocytogenes inject their RNA, RNA into the cytoplasm following infection
 - Protozoa, e.g. Plasmodium falciparum, DNA genome sensed by innate mechanisms

* PRR sensing
 - RIG-I
 - MDA5
 - DHX36
 - Also TLRs like TLR2, 4
 - Signalling via MyD88, MAVS and STING

* Viral RNA sensing
 - RIG-I, MDA5 sensors in cytoplasm, both similar structures
 - RLRs -> type I interferon response
 - The problem is that the host cell has much RNA in the cytoplasm - e.g. mRNAs
 - Different types of RNA detected - e.g. panhandle genomes in influenza, defetive interfering RNA, cite:pmid23896194

* RIG I ligands
 - 5'PPP detected - in viral RNA but not human RNA (TODO reason?)
 - Crystallography studies show a nice binding groove for it

* RLR signalling
 - IPS-1 (MAVS), RIG-I detection of dsRNA
 - homotypic CARD-CARD interactions
 - IRF3, IRF7,  NFkB -> IFN, ISGs activated
 - 5'ppp binding groove deep in helicase pocket
 - comparative crystal structures

* MDA5 structure
 - cite:pmid23273991 - detects really long RNAs that probably shouldnt be there
 - Using in vitro systems
 - forms filaments (lots strung together like beads on a string) around dsRNA
 - CARD domains dimerise to form higher order structure, activates MAVS
 - ligand -> receptor -> conformational change -> signalling cascade activated

* Pattern recognition with DNA
 - DNA detected by several receptors - cGAS, IFI16, DNA-PK
 - DNA-PK, IFI16 activate TBK1, STING pathway
 - IFI16 activates NFkB
 - Presence of DNA in cytoplasm -> IRF3 activation
** Negatively regulated too
 - DNases to dampen down ability to respond to cytoplasmic DNA
 - Control levels of inflammation - otherwise, inflammatory pathogenesis

* Immune response to pathogens
 - Intracellular innate immune DNA signalling is required for protection against DNA virus infection
 - STING is like MAVS but for DNA instead of RNA - adapter protein for the signalling!
 - Mice without dna sensing infected with herpes simplex?
   + STING -/- die
   + cGAS -/- die
   + IRF3 -/- die
 - With huge viral loads in brain (because HSV likes neurones)
 - Cellular consequences - can no longer make ifn\beta or chemokines like cxcl10
 - DNA-PK cite:pmid23251783
 - cGAS - cite:pmid23989956

* Enzymatic regulation of DNA levels
 - nucleases regulate levels of circulating and cellular nucleic acids
 - Blood :: DNase I
 - Endosomes :: DNase II
 - Cytoplasm :: DNase III / Trex1
 - CHop up DNA where there should not be any
 - Without DNase, self-DNA triggers inflammation
 - DNase II knockout - spontaneous TNF driven "arthritis", IFN response limits development
 - DNase -/-, STING -/- double ko rescues phenotype

* Autoimmunity
 - Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome -> autoinflammation
 - Severe neurological and developmental symptoms because too much IFN
 - TrexI mutation, stops DNA clearance, DNA builds up from dying cells, e.g. apoptosis, triggers IFN response

* DNA vaccination
 - Exploit DNA sensing to develop prophylaxis
 - Plasmid encoding antigen from pathogen
 - Inject into body
 - Antigen expressed by some cells and T cell + antibody response develops
 - DNA itself acts as adjuvant because of innate DNA sensing
 - Tolerance develops if no adjuvant!
 - No DNA sensing in TBK -/-, STING -/- or cGAS -/- mice -> no protective response!
 - For DNA immunity, need entry to cells, effective stimulation of DNA sensing for danger signal, expression of antigen in MHC

* Molecular mechanisms of DNA sensing
** Endosomal
 - TLR9 -> detects CpG DNA from bacteria
 - NOT how DNA vaccination works, though thought to be previously because can knockout TLR9 and still have DNA vaccination work
 - Activates NFkB, IRF3, IRF7, etc -> Inflammation
** Cytoplasmic
 - DNA_PK, IFI-16 (also in nucleus? Mysterious), cGAS activate IRF3.
 - ??? -> NFkB
** Inflammasome
 - Complex of AIM2 (PRR), ASC1 (adaptor) and caspase-1 (enzyme that is activated)
 - Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL1\beta to IL1\beta, secreted from cell

* STING
 - cite:pmid23238760
 - DNA activates STING, moves to ER
 - Like MAVS moves to mitochondria - localisation to a membranous structure seems important
 - Recruits TBK1, phosphorylates IRF3 to dissociate it from IKK\epsilon, IRF3 moves to nucleus and transcribes IFN\beta

* cGAS
 - cite:pmid23959130
 - enzyme is a PRR
 - very rare protein
 - synthesises cGAMP upon binding to foreign DNA
 - cGAMP activates STING by binding to a pocket formed by dimer, causes it to shut and somehow translocates
 - STING structure binds to cyclic dinucleotides cite:pmid23238760
 - Structure of AIM2 resolved too
 - PYD-HIN200
 - PYD domain binds to PYD of ASC1
 - ASC1 is PYD-CARD
 - CARD domain binds to caspase CARD domain
 - homotypic binding, forms aggregates of signalling complexes

* DNA-PKcs
 - DNA-PKcs and Ku localise to viral DNA factories during MVA infection
 - DNA-PK activates TBK1, STING, etc

* Important innate signalling pathways are targeted by pathogens!
 - If important, selective pressure on pathogens -> pathogens develop countermeasures -> Red queen
 - C16 protein from Vaccinia directly targets and disables DNA-PK complex
 - Provides confidence that pathway is important

* Take home messages
 - Nucleic acids are potently immunostimulatory when found as non-self structures or in the wrong location
 - Detection of DNA by innate immune system is crucial for fighting pathogens or to warn of tissue damage
 - Multiple mechanisms for detection of DNA
 - Cytoplasmic sensing of DNA is crucial for fighting pathogens
 - Regulation is important, dysregulation results in imunopathology, e.g. autoimmunity
 - Buildup of DNA leads to inflammatory signalling!
