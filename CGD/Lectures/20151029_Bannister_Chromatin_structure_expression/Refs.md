ChIP on CHIP

Types:
- Methylation (PHD domains, chromo domains of Royal proteins)
- Acetylation (Bromodomains)
- Phosphorylation (13-3-3 domain)
- Ubiquitylation
- Sumoylation
- ADP ribosylation
- Deimination
- Proline isomerisation
- B N acetylglucosaminylation
- Tail clipping

Enzymes for all found, but no demethylase for arginines

Arginines - mono/di methylation (asymmetrical, symmetrical)

Evidence for function very correlative - present when x, not present when not x. - levels of confidence on how far research has gone to show it

Can never exclude possibility that modification of other substrates by enzyme causes response

methyltransferases and kinases most specific

## acetylation
transcriptional activation
deacetylation -> transcriptional repression

## ADP ribosylation
can be mono or poly, done by MARTs or PARPs
ill defined with respect to function
DSBs activate PARP-1

# Bannister and Kouzardes, 2011

Allfrey, 1964 -> histone acetylation

acetylation of lysines is highly dynamic

## Acetylation
HATs use Acetyl CoA, add onto lysine, weaken positive charge, weaken interactions between histones and DNA

Type A and type B. Type B only free histones in cytoplasm - scHat1 founding member, all share homology with it

Type A more diverse, three groups - GNAT, MYST, CBP/p300
Often found in large multimeric complexes, controlling enzyme recruitment and activity
e.g. scGCN5 acetylates only free histones but not in a nucleosome. In SAGA complex, acetylates nucleosomal histones

HDACs have low substrate specificity, and enzymes present in multiple distinct complexes
HDAC1 but not 2 controls embryonic stem cell differentiation

## Phosphorylation
Aurora B lays down genome wide H3S10ph and H3S28ph duing mitosis
Antagonised by PP1 phosphatase

Alters charge significantly of histone

## Lysine methylation
SUV39H1 targets H3K9
HKMTs target using S-adenosylmethionine

Guilt by association - associate lncRNAs with pathways and cell types

Enforced transcription of HOTAIR in HOXC enough to result in metastasis of breast cancer cells

Twice as much RNA as DNA in chromatin (Paul and Duerksen, 1975)

Xist physically associates with inactive X and recruits Polycomb repressor (PRC) to add histone marks (H3K27me3)

HOTAIR physically associates with PRC2 and REST/Co-REST and modulates its tethering to many sites along genome

In imprinting, differential expression from parent of origin, Air transcribed from silent paternal allele, mediating H3K9me3 and silencing of Kcnq1 or Igf2r

SRA, an lncRNA, can interact and enhance funcion of CTCF insulator protein.
