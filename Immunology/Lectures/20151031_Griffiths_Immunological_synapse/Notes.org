* Reading a paper:
- What are the main conclusions?
- Are they supported by the data?
- Are the methods used appropriate?
   + Read the methods section!

* Immune system stuff
- Many cells in the immune system
- They must communicate with each other to form an efficient adaptive response
- One way is through the immunological synapse

* (Paul and Seder, 1994)
- Focused secretion of cytokines into a small area
- Increases apparent concentration
- Directed to individual cell rather than paracrine signalling to everywhere

* (Poe and Janeway, 1988)
- Directed secretion of IL4 from T cells over area of TCR crosslinking

* (Kupfer, Mossman and Kupfer, 1991)
- Immunofluorescence microscopy
- IL2,4,5 and IFN\gamma secreted directly toward B cell conjugates
- microtubule organisation centre = MTOC, polarised toward point of secretion

* Confocal microscopy
- Confocal microscopy, uses laser and blocks out of focus light
- Increases resolution of images

* (Monks et al, 1998)
- Talins interact with integrins
- PCK\phi interacts with TCR
- Imaging it, can see a cSMAC which forms in the centre, (PKC\phi with TCR), and pSMAC around it (talins)

- Review :: (Delon and Germain, 2000)

* Role of the immunological synapse
- Enhance signalling?
- Downregulate signalling?
- Polarise signalling?

- TCR recruits Lck, Zap70, balanced by CD45 phosphatase


* (Springer, 1990)
- Signalling proteins are smaller than phosphatases (which have huge extracellular domains)
- Close contact excludes CD45 from membrane, could affect signalling?
- Maybe reason for cSMAC to cluster signalling molecules together is to exclude CD45
- Kinetic segregation model, (David and van der Merwe, 2006)

* Test this using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies
- TCR shown to be activated at periphery of synapse at early timepoints (Lee et al, 2012)
- Perhaps cSMAC therefore downregulates T cell signalling?

* TIRF - Total internal reflection microscopy
- Images 200nm above coverslip
- Con :: Does not let you see rest of cell
- (Samelson et al, 2010) - create artificial synapses to image interaction
- Supported lipid bilayer :: artificial bilayer with peptide-MHC complexes embedded
- Con :: No actin skeleton, but otherwise pretty good model
- Coated coverslip :: Poor mans version, with anti TCR antibodies fixed
- Con :: Nothing can move around, much less motile!

* TCR transgenic mice as model
- Rag -/- background so monoclonal mice

- Centripetal inward flow of actin causes inward movement of TCR microtubules to form cSMAC
- Hence early specs?
- But what happens to TCR of cSMAC?
- CD45 excluded from TCR areas in microtubules, included in cSMAC
- Signalling ONLY in microclusters? Signalling all over by cSMAC? - downregulating TCRs?
- Immunological synapse as point of internalisation for TCR?
- Control level of signalling?

* (Lui et al, 2000)
- TCR delivered to immulogoical synapse

* (Vardhana et al, 2010)
- Review TSG101
- TSG101 knockdown prevents cSMAC formation

* But synapse does not seem to be all about downregulation
- Change extracellular domain by using Thy1 of CD45
- Could turn off activatopm, since CD45 could come right next to TCR
- Shorter/larger domain controlled ability to trigger activation
- In CD8 cells, cSMAC leads to receptor signalling!

* Secretion hypothesis
- (Huse, Quann and Davis, 2008)
- CD8 cells focus secretion directing to kill
- CD4 cells focus secretion to signal
- Structure for focal secretion?

- CTLs and NK cells destroy tumorigenic and virally infected cells
- Lytic granules move along microtubules and secrete their contents at immunological synapse

- NK cells = non specific defence
- CTLs = several days later, but more specific
- Perforin -> forms pores
- Granzymes -> activates caspases
- Fas ligand

- T cell can sense it has killed target, removes self and can kill again
- Precise delivery important - increases effective conc, decreases collateral damage by targetting

* Lymphocytes
- Centrosome = MTOC
- Most cells, nestle next to nucleus
- Chromosome segregation uses
- T cells, when moving around, centrosomes at rear of cell (stain \gamma-tubulin)
- Moves to front, scans immunological synapse, comes to focus at one spot - cSMAC
- Lck

* (Stinchcombe et al, 2006)
- Reorganises microtubules
- Polarises for secretion
- ALL cytolytic cells - NK cells, \gamma\delta cells, etc

- Secretion occurs in a specialised domain in the immunological synapse - the secretory domain

- dSMAC = distal SMAC
- Granules are delivered where actin is cleared
- Superrresolution microscopy - shows actin not cleared at all! All over synapse

* (Brown et al, 2011) (Rak et al, 2011)
- Collinder/toilet bowl model
- Short microtubules from the centrosome make the final delivery
- granule contents secreted into a small cleft
- Golgi apparatus becomes closely polarised to plasma membrane when centrioles dock
- Hence, any new proteins being made are secreted at synapse too
- EM tomography - in CD4+ cells too (Uedelt et al, 2011)

* So synapse all about secretion?
- Centrosome docking is unusual - focal point for endocytosis and exocytosis
- Primary and motile cilia
- Known to be secretion and endocytosis at cilium too
- (Griffiths et al, 2010)
- Endocytosis for cytokines, accidentally take in TCRs?
- Centrosome is causing specialisation of membrane for secretion and endocytosis

* What are the proteins that make CTLs and NK cells efficient killers?
- Perforin - like C9 of complement
- Lysosomes contain hydrolases and granzymes (granule contained enzymes)
- + perforin to create pore and inject material
- Ca2+ dependant C2 like part, hence only activates when released

* Controversy over granzyme activity
- Uptake by endocytosis with perforin into endosomes, where it does things
- Con :: Problem is that perforin to form pores in very pH sensitive, around pH 7 - endosomes become acidic very quickly
- Entry through perforin pore at plasma membrane - most evidence for this

- Some viruses make decoy targets for granzymes, hence multiple substrate specifities from different granzymes

* (Stepp et al, Science, 1999)
- Perforin as defective gene in FLH/HLH
- FLH not downregulating to memory cells!
- Hence infiltration of organs
- 20% of FHL have mutations in perforin
- Rest in exocytosis pathway
- Albinism - melanocyte secretion defect

- FHL mutations block secretion at synapse
- Docking (Rab27a), Priming (Muc13-4), Fusion (Syntaxin 11, Munc 18-2)
- Syntaxins and Munc proteins -> membrane fusion
- Membrane fusion tightly regulated
- Munc proteins regulate fusion events
- Munc13 holds SNAREs open
- Munc18 binds to syntaxins - selection of right one? Delivery by bringing it to right place?

* HLH
- IL2 cures Munc mutations from FLH in vitro
- Diseases indistinguishable otherwise from perforin mutations otherwise

- Munc 18-2 protein binds syntaxin 11 selectively, and syntaxin 3 at 20x less affinity
- IL2 upregulates syntaxin 3
- Syntaxins interchangeable
- Hence upregulation -> restores function

* SCID
- ZAP70 mutation -> no TCR activation -> no selection in thymus
- but normal NK cells -> totally different signalling
- Hence dont develop FHL -> have NK cells
