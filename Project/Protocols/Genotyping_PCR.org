* Tissue digestion
- Put tail into lysis buffer to release DNA (proteinase K)
- Obtain a crude lysate - digets tissues, incubate for 3 hours at 55oC

** Using crude lysate
- Inactivate protease by incubation for 45 mins at 85oC
- Otherwise PCR wont work (protease will digest PCR polymerase!)
- 1\microL of the 200\microL crude lysate for PCR

** More sensitive samples
- Purify DNA from lysate
- Add salt and isopropanol to precipitate out nucleic acids
