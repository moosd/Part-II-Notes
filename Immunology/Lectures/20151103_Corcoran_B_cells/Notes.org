* Intro
- B cell development in bone marrow - antigen independant
- Naive antibody repertoire
- Restricts potential
- LMPP - Lymphoid Myeloid Progenitor
- (Mercer et al, Seminars in Immunology)
- Ikaros and PU1 critical for determining fate

- Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP) ( T or B cell)
- E2A, Notch, etc push towards T cell lineage
- E2A, Ikaros, EBF, Foxo1 push to B cell lineage
- Commitment - just makes antibodies

* Transcription factor network
- Pax5 - commitment factor for B cells
- Up to this stage, quite plastic
- Pax5 knockout -> in early B cells, no recombination of Ig -> no further progression
- Left cultures in incubator, differentiated into other cell types - T cells, NK cells, etc
- Removes ability to commit to a lineage

- All transcriptional factors act coordinated - regulate each other, regulate often overlapping sets of genes
- Mext generation sequencing - build up picture of what genes regulate
- Computational modelling

* B cell development
- Biological classification
- Technical classification - flow cytometry
- Hardy = Philadelphia classification
- B220 :: metalloprotein phosphatase - always on B cells
- CD19 :: marker of commitment (Pax5) - function is actually later in B cell development
- Cell surface markers, can also look at transcriptional profiles
- Downregulation of RAG enzyme -> allelic exclusion
- Reupregulation -> rearranging light chains

* VDJ
- D->J first
- Most diversity from V->DJ
- How is igH recombination happening ONLY in B cells?
- Accessibility hypothesis
- Non coding transcripts found - two of them
- From last D gene
- Chromatin open and accessible for recombination
- The next stage, ncRNA over V genes
- For various sequential stages to occur
- Transcriptional factors cause looping for recombination
- All open, all able to recombine to same extent

* Models
- Stochastic modelling
- RAG enzymes themselves recruit Ig alleles together, pairing of IgH alleles
- Two accessible, bound by RAG and brought together
- One cleaved. ATM sequesters second allele to pericentric heterochromatin
- Cant be recombined

- If recombination not productive, second allele can detach from pericentric heterochromatin
- Lots of dynamic signalling
- Before polypeptide is made, ATM recruits second allele
   + Sequestering second allele
   + Then maintenance of this by pre-BCR signalling

- Must proliferate lots after recombination event -> only 1 in 3 are productive
- Must divide to recover cell pool for next recombination

- IL7 drives B cell proliferation
- IL7R and preBCR synergise
- Then downregulates IL7R
- IL7R activates complementary proliferative pathways
- Ultimately dependant on preBCR then BCR, autonomous from stromal cells that secrete IL7

* Heavy chain
- VpreB and \lambda5 act as surrogate light chain
- CDR3 - 3' end of V and D and 5' end of J

* Light genes
- only V and J genes
- Allelic exclusion in different one
- kappa chain silences one allele, recombines other allele (cf H chain, other way round, which recombines then silences)
- CpG methylation to supress recombination

- acetylated histone over J genes first
- one allele recruited to pericentric heterochromatin by Ikaros

- REL-B takes out DNA methylation mark
- One allele can recombine, other cannot
- Light chain heavy chain alleles recruited to pericentric heterochromatin together

* BCR receptor editing
- Immature BCR cell stage#
- If BCR functional, goes on and exits to blood
- Non functional, kappa chain can undergo receptor editing
- Jk2 not functional? Try Jk3,4,...
- Also to remove self reactive BCRs

- Order of usage of kappa alleles strict
- Both kappa used first before lambda

* Differences in ratios
- Humans - more efficient? Mouse must apoptose more cells because of non functional lambda chain
- Whereas humans have more lambda chains, so can keep going for longer?

* Diseases
- SCID - defective VDJ recombination
- Omenn's syndrome - immunodeficiency with facial features
   + RAG mutation
- RF-SCID - mutation in DNA repair, less of NHEJ pathway

** At level of genome
- Chromosomal translocation
- Aberrant VDJ recombination
- RSS not that rigid - many cryptic RSSs in genome
- In right situations, lead to derivative chromosomes?
- Chromosomal translocation with nuclear proximity
- B cell lymphoma - Igh-Bcl2

- MYC - chr 15 in mice, 8 in humans
- FISH for MYC and Igh, colocalise a lot
- Transcription factory (focus of transcription)
- Chromatin quite open
- Aberrant recombination event

- Burtkitts lymphoma

- XLA from mutations in Btk gene

** Defective B cell development during ageing
- Erythrocutes do well - can donate blood up to 70 years old
- Lymphocytes not so well - can donate bone marrow up to 40 years
- Otherwise, will not replenish immune system
- Far fewer of them, make far fewer new antibodies, multiply slowly
- Increased susceptibility to new infections
- Decreased response to vaccines
- Ageing leads to decreased production of IL7 from stromal cells, decrease in signalling response to IL7
- First stage of defective response to infection
