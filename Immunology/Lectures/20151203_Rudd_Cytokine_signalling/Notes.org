* Intro
    - WASP
    - Integrins
    - Cytokines
    - Chemokines

* WASP
    - Most tyrosine in microclusters, cSMAC, pSMAC, etc
    - Downregulation of TCR important
    - Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein, X linked primary immunodeficiency
      disorder, defect in immune system increasing susceptibility to
      infection while giving autoimmune disease
    - Actin cytoskeleton not formed properly - first evidence linking
      signalling event with this disorder
    - Lymphopenic but autoimmunity - paradoxical
    - WASp - regulator of actin cytokeleton, elongation of actin cables
    - Interact with ARP complex, and G-actins
    - Little like a kinase, exists in closed inhibited form, opens up and
      becomes active
    - Cdc42, GTP binding protein, leads further downstream with actin-ARP
      complex, elongation key to downregulation of TCR. Dynamic process.
    - Extension of cables downregulate TCR
    - When mutation, TCR not downregulated, immune deficiency disorder
    - Affects Tregs more than normal T cells, hence autoimmunity

* Integrins
    - Inside out signalling pathway
    - Intracellular adaptor proteins specifically for TCR signalling (AAP,
      SKAP)
    - Susceptibility to bacterial infections
    - CD18 (LFA beta chain) for motility
    - Mutations in processing integrins - LADS disorders

* Cytokines
    - Tregs make suppressive IL-10
    - CCR5 promotes migration to lymph nodes (Used by HIV)
    - Arthritis - anti-TNF, anti-IL1 , anti-IL17
    - Cytokines employ innate type pathwa linked to NFkB -> inflammatory
      disprders
    - Others linked to different signaling pathways
    - Northwood Park - cytokine storm incident
    - Cytokine receptor - JAK pathway phosphorylates STATs, tyrosine
      phosphorylation cascade, STATs dimerise, migrate to nucleus, act as
      transcriptional activators
    - JH = Janus homology domains
    - JAK kinases - men growing hair back
    - JH domains 3d similarity to SH2 domains to mediate binding
    - STATs = Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
    - IL2 ko -> autoimmunity? What? Because they are important for Tregs!
      That express high affinity IL2 receptor
    - Effectors of specific immune functions - IL2,4, etc
    - Danger cytokines - effectors of inflammation - IL1, IL17
    - IL1 signalling pathway as more primitive innate systems, but very
      complicated pathway with many components
    - IL17 very different structurally to Il2,4, etc receptors
    - Interacts through TRAF molecules

* Chemokines
    - One cytokines act as a chemoattractant, but rest done by chemokines
    - Chemokine receptors are GPCRs
    - GPCRs make up 2% of human genome
    - Add a little chemokine in pipette tip, slowly eject chemokine, cell
      comes alive
    - CXCR4 on T cells and CCR5 on macrophages required for HIV entry
    - CCR5 delta 32 selected for in smallpox infection resistance
