Exome sequencing

Discrete filtering, powerful to narrow down to single gene but dbSNP is contaminated with small number of pathogenic alleles, and
Second, as the number of sequenced
exomes and genomes increases, the filtering of
observed alleles in a manner that is independent of their
minor allele frequency (MAF) runs the risk of eliminat ing truly pathogenic alleles that are segregating in the
general population at low but appreciable frequencies.
This risk is especially relevant for recessive disorders, in
which carrier status will not result in a phenotype that
might otherwise exclude an individual from a ‘control’
population (for example, 1000 Genomes Project)

Four ways of using exome seq data - multiple unrelated, family, parent-child trio, extreme of quantitative

A clear limitation of exome sequencing is that it does not identify
the structural and noncoding variants found by whole genome
sequencing. At the same time, it allows a given amount of sequencing
to be extended across at least 20 times as many samples compared to
whole genome sequencing. In studies focused on identifying rare
variants or somatic mutations with medical relevance, sample size
and the interpretability of functional impact may be critical to
achieving meaningful success. It is in the context of such studies that
exome sequencing may be most valuable

first paper to discover cause of Miller syndrome, DHODH mutation, filtered against HapMap and SNP database
One family has unique to miller patients, copd and lung infections, found in exome due to mutation in dnah5 -> primary ciliary dyskinesia
Sanger sequencing to confirm
leflunomide, blocking pyrimidine synthesis by blocking dihydroorotate dehydrogenase also gives similar defects in pregnant mice offspring
