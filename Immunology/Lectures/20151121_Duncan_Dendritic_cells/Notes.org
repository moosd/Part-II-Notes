* Intro
    - Activate the adaptive immune response
    - Present antigens, also educate the adaptive immune response
    - Without them, we would only have the innate immune response
    - Only DC cells can regulate T, B and NK cells
    - Master regulators and educators

* Innate
    - Dont recognise what it is
    - Sense damage and inflammation, destroy it
    - Same severity of response, no memory

* Dendritic cells
    - Detect nature of infection
    - Collect pathogenic particles
    - Seek out naive T and B cells to activate them
    - Optimises antigen capture, cant expect T cells to be everywhere, only
      a few T cells to an antigen
    - Go down lymphatic system
    - Lymph nodes are close to areas of infection
    - Small numbers of DCs can activate large numbers of T cells
    - Dendritic cells licence T cells
    - CD4 cells can help activate CD8 cells further
    - Many many activation events, slow and steady. Spatially and temporally
      related, T cell doesnt just get activated, need lots of signalling,
      much of this happens in lymph nodes
    - T cells specific, stay with DC, start to mature and amplify and
      duplicate, other T cells not recognising specific antigen leave back
      out and go back into circulation
    - T cells leave to attack infection, some become memory cells
    - Next time, may not even notice

* Specialised areas of DC function
    - DCs may bring pathogen education right where infection is
    - Peyers patches - like lymph nodes but tiny and all along gut
    - DCs rely on health of M cells (microfold) - highly phagocytic, sampling
      intestinal fluids, allow transmission into mini germinal centre, with
      follicles, education right there.
    - Induce tolerance against food particles, but also if infection, need to
      respond to that
    - Difference made by PAMPs, DANGER/damage. Damaged cells signal too. Just
      bc LPS (gut has more cells than human cells). PAMPs always there,
      doesnt mean danger
    - DCs can sample antigen directly by extending processes through gut
      epithelium
    - Assist in thymic selection of T cells

* Dendritic cell lineage
    - Mnay types of DCs like many types of CD4 T cells
    - Common myeloid progenitors -> DCs, also MLP -> DCs
    - classical DCs, plasmacytoid DCs
    - Talk of non lymphoid tissue DCs, spontaneously appearing DCs,
      classification expanding every day
    - Be aware that the mouse is very different from human!
    - Cannot always directly refer back to human, some viruses evade immune
      system differently in mice vs humans
    - cDC = tissue resident DCs
    - pDCs - specialise at detecting viruses in blood

* Differentiation
    - Immature DCs poor at MHC presentation, low costimulatory molecules
    - When initial danger signals occur, DCs begin to mature, needs many
      steps before fully active
    - Initially upregulates class I and II, expresses costimulatory molecules
    - Langerhans cells - MIP3a sensed (from epithelial cells) through CCR6,
      goes to epithelium
    - On encounter with antigen, downregulates CCR6, expresses CCR7 to guide
      it down to lymph node

* Signalling
    - COMMUNICATION - lots of signals, direct or indirect, necessary to
      develop active response
    - Can become infected and present antigen
    - Can also cross present viral particles
    - TLRs check identity of invader
    - Endosomal TLRs sense viral antigens. why? Obvs facilitate
      macropinocytosis, but another reason... Dont want to sense nucleic acid
      in cytosol because they're there already! Try to locally separate
      sensing of viral particles
    - pDCs phagocyte viruses in blood
    - cytosolic PAMPs receptors, signal different cytokines
    - Intelligent response - not unrecognised response like innate
    - IL-12
    - Three crucial steps, spatial and temporal control. Signal 1 = delivery
      of antigen by MHC, signal 2 = costim molecules, signal 3 = induction of
      cytokines
    - Signal 1 = activation signal 2 = long term survival, signal 3 =
      differentiation in particular direction
    - Sinal 3 is a powerful immunomodulatory signal. IL4 -> Th2 cells, IL-12,
      IFN-\gamma -> Th1 cells, TGF\beta (from epithelial cells) -> Treg cells
    - IL-10 has multiple roles. Not just nature of cytokine. Often secreted
      as cocktail. Not what cytokine but how much and what combination?
    - High TGF\beta, low IL6,IL23 -> go home, Tregs form
    - High TGF-\beta, high IL6, IL23 -> Th17 to kill infections
    - DC needs additional signals to fully activate! If CD4+ cell recognising
      antigen of similar class -> double recognition causes CD40/CD40L
      expression, signal to DC to stay alive
    - T cell activation, will secrete some nasty stuff! Costim molecules,
      etc. But dendritic cell stays alive big time? Dendritic cells express
      serpins, inhibitors of perforins on surface. But eventually DCs die -
      DC doesnt have to stay stimulating T cells when no more infection. same
      for innate cells like neutrophils, eosinophils. They themselves become
      lysed, negative feedback

* Cross presentation
    - virus may have tropism to different cell type
    - Some bacteria can alter endosome and stay alive
    - Tolerance or immunity - signal 3
    - multivesicular bodies, class II and class I in these MIICs.
    - endosomes start to become acidified, point to degrade proteins
    - These ones dont do this, higher pH than lysosomes, process proteins for
      class I and class II
    - Three main mechanisms for x presentation
        - Direct access to cytosol, intracellular pathogens - viruses,
          listeria, mycobacteria
        - Active transport back out into cytosol from endosomes/phagosomes
        - Loading of class I molecules in MIICs themselves
            - Evidence that bits of ER bud off, merge with endosome
            - Potentially, when endocytosis, class I in membrane remains
    - MHC class I not just viruses. Cross presentation crucial

* Disease
    - Unfortunately DCs are susceptible to disease. Goes from periphery to
      lymphoid organs to interact with T cells.
    - HIV binds to receptor but avoids endocytosis, Sitting on surface, goes
      to lymph node, infect naive CD4 T cells
    - Virus just sitting at surface waiting for 100s of CD4 T cells
    - Role in allergy development
    - Proteins/leftover from proteins (Der p1 is an enzyme from dustmites
      excrement)
    - Taken up, cuts tight junction between epithelial cells, recognised by
      DCs, activate innate arm of immune system, create allergic response
    - Enzyme activates DC to bring in mast cells
    - Role in food allergy, 40% of world population allergic to gluten?
    - Big bellies but not fat - could be gluten sensitive!
    - Role in contact sensitivity - haptens
    - Organs unmatched not rejected! No damage involved, no danger signals.
      No other danger signals, DCs role in inducing tolerance. Heart could
      come from any MHC reperetoire. Would have donors dendritic cells. Could
      come out of heart, go to lymph nodes, cause trouble. Two different
      types of problems.
        - GvHD - dendritic cells in transplanted organ and and attacking
          recipient
        - Graft rejection - own dendritic cells recognising graft (esp if
          danger signal or if immune system in overreactive state) and reject
          graft
    - Try to irradiate and kill dendritic cells

Tutorial - find pathogen, different DCs, id, what signal is, and lots of examples from
      different parts of the body, areas, etc. Try to adapt all it into
      medieval city. How that responds to invasion.
