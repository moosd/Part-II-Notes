# Zhang et al, 2009
L1, Alu, SVAs

NHEJ
NAHR

For more complex ones:
FoSTeS (stalled fork) /MMBIR (collapsed/broken fork) (based on microhomology)
SRS - Serial Replication Slippage (within fork)
Multiple NHEJ

# Ding et al, 2006
L1 LINE elements
ORF1 - RNA binding
ORF2 endonuclease and retrotranscriptase
Inserts into TTTT^A concensus
Can then also insert pps, retrogenes, Alu elements, B1 and SVA elements

## types of mutagenesis
- insertion into functional sequences
- can cause exon skipping/alt splicing
- l1 has sense and antisense promoter actiity, 5' gene may be activated
- nahr opportunity

## consequences
- glo insertion - no more vit c synthesis
- retrogene can insert (functional pp)

# Cordaux and Batzer, 2009
l1 = target primed reverse transcription, 500,000 copies, <100 active
alu= parasites parasite, 1,000,000
sva = 300,000
together, 1/3 of genome

old nonative - l2 and its mir parasite, 6% of genome

## mutagenesis
- insertional mutagenesis
- orf2 generates more dsbs than insertions  (Gasior et al, 2006)
- non retroviral te's involved in dsb repair too - when endonuclease independant
    -> ancestral rna mediated dna repair before endonuclease domain acquired? 
- source of microsatellites
- Alu gene conversion - renders SNPs in Alu elements Identity by state rather than identity by descent

## rearrangements
- insertion mediated deletions
- nahr

## epigenetic
- 1/3 of all CpG sites in Alu sequences
- Because theye found near genes, could silence nearby ones
- may help in x inactivation since rich on x chromosome - as booster stations

# Demuth and Hahn, 2009
- Muller's dictum - every gene from another gene
- 

# Belancio et al, 2010
- Retroelements can be involved in cancer
- Increased DSBs
- Activated by p53, triggers senescence
- Alu promote miRNA
