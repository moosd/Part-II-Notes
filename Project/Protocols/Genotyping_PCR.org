* Tissue digestion
    - Put tail into lysis buffer (Viagen DirectPCR Lysis reagent for ears) to release DNA (proteinase K)
    - Obtain a crude lysate - digest tissues, incubate for 3 hours at 55oC
    - Inactivate proteinase K by incubating further for 45 mins at 85oC
    - Take 100\microL of this to use for genotyping
    - Otherwise PCR wont work (protease will digest PCR polymerase!)

** More sensitive samples
    - Purify DNA from lysate
    - Add salt and isopropanol to precipitate out nucleic acids
    - Mix the 100 \microL of crude lysate with 5\microL 5M NaCL and
         73.5\microL isopropanol to precipitate out DNA
    - isopropanol to precipitate DNA by removing hydration shell
    - Na+ increases precipitation efficiency by shifting equilibrium
        Na+ + DNA- <=> Na-DNA
    - Vortex for 5 seconds for DNA to appear
    - Centrifuge max speed (14.8x1000rpm) for 2 mins to bring it to the
      bottom
    - Discard supernatant
    - Wash with 1ml 75% ethanol
    - Centrifuge for 1 min again
    - Discard supernatant
    - Centrifuge briefly
    - Aspirate remaining supernatant with 200\microL pipette tip
    - Air dry for 5 minutes
    - Reconstitute DNA with 100\microL of dH2O
    - Measure concentration on NanoDrop spectrophotometer

* PCR
    - Dilute down samples that are > 150ng/\microL down to somewhere between
      10-100ng/\microL by adding dH2O
    - Set up reaction master mix from spreadsheet
    - Then dispense given aliquots of master mix and add primers into assay
      mix eppendorfs (10mM primers, if none left dilute 100mM stock down)
    - Then pipette out onto PCR tubes, 19\microL and add 1\microL of
      templates
    - Cap strips with strip caps - press hard and label columns!
    - Spin down in mini centrifuge (Labnet) then be careful to ensure fluid
      remains at bottom of tube
    - Open PCR machine lid, put tubes in and tighten hot lid (heated to
      prevent condensation)
    - Run PCR (PETER->HOTSTART), 20\microL reaction volume, with
      polypropylene plates and tubes
    - Press start

* Agarose gel
    - 200\microL 1.5% agarose gel
    - Temperature dependant, unlike PAGE gel
    - TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA) or TBE (Tris-Borate-EDTA) used
    - Tape ends of container to be able to pour gel
    - Using TAE - dilute to 1x
    - Add after weighing agarose powder to flask
    - Pour on TAE to required volume
    - Mix, microwave to head until it boils, cool, boil again, stirring every
      now and then
    - Cool to 60oC and add intercalating dye (Ethidium bromide or SYBRsafe)
      (1 in 1000 -> 20\microL)
    - And pour gel, wait for it to set
