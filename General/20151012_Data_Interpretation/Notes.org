* Central tendancy
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

* Spread
- range
- IQR
- standard deviation

* Dealing with skew
- Geometric mean of titres/concentrations instead if skew (log'd)

* Normal distribution
- 68% = 1 \sigma
- 95% = 2 \sigma
- 99.7% = 3 \sigma

* Confidence intervals
- Building evidence against a null hypothesis
- Z test, or if small data set, t-test

* p values
- lower p -value = stronger evidence against H0
- Higher p value, less evidence
- Nothing magical about 0.05
- Too big a p value may mean sample size is not big enough to show an effect
- Report *actual* p-value, not just p > 0.05 - gives measure of amount of evidence

* Type of hypothesis test
- Two means, Z test/F test
- Many means, ANOVA

* Interpretations
- Plot data - may not be linear!

* Interpretations of data
- No of subjects/experiments
- Data visualisations?
- Statistical test described? Is it appropriate?
- Interpret 95% CI and p value
- Biological significance
- Agree with conclusions of author? Or does the data tell you something different?
