* Hypothesis between why we have genomic imprinting
    - Alternative hypotheses? Maternal aoffspring
    - Problem with coming up with theory of genomic imprinting - needs to
      explain many things! Being why doesnt every chromosome have imprinted
      genes, some kos to lethality? Particular growth effects? Imprinting
      particularly important for growth and metabolism, why only in placental
      mammals?
    - No unifying theory of genomic imprinting
    - Some not taken too seriously, proposed by non molecular evolutionist
    - Two theories stand out - proposed by those that study evolution,
      mathematically modelled
    - Genetic conflict theory, maternal coadaptation theory for imprinting
    - Conflict - David Haig - kinship theory
    - Selective pressure for imprinting, need situation of multiple paternity
    - Dont have multiple paternity, shouldnt have imprinting
    - Breeding scheme monogamous, degree relatedness high, no selective
      pressure for imprinting
    - Any given maternal allele, offspring will always be related to each
      other and mother by 0.5
    - Situation of monogamy, same for father
    - High degree of genetic relatedness
    - High degree of relatednes hence
    - Multiple paternity, less than 0.5, depends on species and
      promiscuousity, cat within single litter can have different fathers
    - Alleles have possibility to be selected in favour of favorable trait,
      e.g. growth factor, idea that paternal gene will be selfish and extract
      as many resources from parent as it can without taking into account
         other offspring.
    - Igf2 - optimal level for paternal genes higher because lower degree of
      relatedness
    - Mother then responds to this by silencing growth factor from her OWN
      allele. Father makes more of transcript, mother makes less
    - Over many generations, outcome is paternal levels so high that only
      paternal allele expressed, maternal allele silenced
    - Need multiple paternity to force system to be selfish and work

* Maternal coadaptation
    - Dont need conflict
    - Mother and offspring relationship
    - Proposed because it seems there are more maternally expressed genes
      than paternal ones
    - Slightly controversial
    - Not controversial - primary imprints. Imprintation occurs in germ
      cells, DNA methylation important
    - Most of them in terms of DNA methylation are maternal. Much more
      maternal methylation to control imprinting than paternal. Only two
      paternal we know of.
    - Think its all about control of the mother. Interest of mother and
      offspring to coadapt and cooperate to mutual benefit.
    - A  little like host-parasite relationship - imprinting exists to
      balance those traits, ensures mutual benefits and mother.
    - Mother is controlling parent
    - Parent that gives more investment to offspring, some species where this
      is paternal in origin, postulates that in those cases, would see more
      paternal methylation than maternal. Paternal coadaptation thory?
      Maternal called because explored in mammals.

* Conflict again
    - Why does it exist in plants? Coevolved independantly in two kingdoms.
      Imprinting in plants retricted to those with endosperm, "equivalent" to
      placenta, reserve organ to provide nutrients to embryo. Point of view
      of conflict theory can explain nicely - strengths is that it explains
      phylogenetic distribution. No imprinting in egg laying, amount of
      nutrients are fixed, embryo cannot manipulate nutrients amount
      extracted. Hence, same applies to the plants
    - Original proposals of conflict - explains in plants
    - Maternal gene bias detected in placenta - tissue with 70% fetal origin,
      30% from mother. Some genes found wrongly classified as maternally
      expressed because contamination by maternal tissue. Maternal decidua
      gives bias.
    - Not sure if totally tre there are more maternally expressed than
      paternally expressed
    - Igf2 as major growth factor. System with many maternal expressed
      systems to supress this, hence also explained by conflict theory
    - Doesnt explain why if ko MASH2 (transcription factor, aka ASCL2, plays
        role in placental differentiation) - ko, no placenta early on->
      lethality, need to explain through bystander effect, imprinted gene
      spread to other genes
    - Hence no single theory of imprinting? Conflict theory explains nicely
      for growth related ones, resource acquisition. Also suckling as
      resource allocation, species with strong second period (marsupials,
      platypus), room for imprinting. Platypus, egg laying, fixed nutrients,
      but long period of suckling.
    - Different selective pressures, multiple theories true? Mechanistic
      theory. DNA methylation evolves to silence parasitic elements.
      Imprinted genes have evolved exactly that system? Methylation going
      awry - imprinted genes are very rich in repeat elements. May be true at
      some loci?
    - No unified theory for imprinting, there are many of them. Different
      pressures working together?

* Imprinted genes, how are they different?
    - Repeat elements, slightly controversial
    - Imprinting all about transcription
    - May exist where levels of differential expression - can have all or
      nothing, or 75/25, differential expression at level of transcripts.
      PARENT OF ORIGIN
    - Every single one has differentially methylated regions
    - Placenta exception - many genes not to do with methylation
    - As a rule, most imprinted genes show differeces in methylation in one
      allele vs other, can be somatic (occured post fertilisation) or gametic
      (present from germ cells)
    - ICR1 - paternally methylated in sperm, maternally unmethylated in oocyte,
      igf2
    - Somatic one, H19, methylation from paternal allele spreads over to body
      of gene from ICR1, somatic acquisition of methylation, soon after
      fertilisation
    - ICR is a gametic DMR
    - ICR needs to be gametic, needs to delete, functional assay, or
      directing methylation to this region and see if effect on neighbouring
      imprinted genes
    - Know a little about primary mark at Igf2, CTCF bound in oocyte already.
      Not in sperm because methylation.
    - SEQUENCE IS THE SAME
    - Specific germ line producing proteins that other doesnt.
    - Methylation important inboth gametic and somatic control

    - * = silenced, o=methylated, x=unmethylated
    - Paternal
         ----(Igf2)--------O---(*H19)-----(enhancer)
                             -> spreads to H19
    - maternal
        -----(*Igf2)------X---(h19)

    - Imprinting based on whatever happens during sex determination
    - MODEL :: Proteins bound to DNA differntially, everything not bound
      gets methylated
    - Sensitivity of mass spec not high enough to find small amounts of tiny
      proteins that bind like this

* Lamarck
    - Trans = no direct exposure
    - Inter = some direct exposure
    - Transgenerational epigenerational inheritance
    - Pesticide to mother when germ cells migrate to genital ridge
    - Injected super high levels of endocrine disruptor
    - Analysed offspring for phenotypes
    - Initial -> males infertility, long past exposure, cannot be genetic,
      too high for mutation, dreadful epigenetic studies
    - Published also female phenotypes
    - Several groups replicate and failed.
    - Intergenerational one believed. Not after F3 or F2. Because waves of
      reprogramming? Perhaps systems there to do that?
    - Environment constantly changing, hence evolutionarily favourable to
      keep wiping and going
    - recent paper 2-3weeks ago with most convincing of epigenetic
      inheritance (check email, Antoine Peters, Siklenka et al, 2015 -
        10.1126/science.aab2006)
    - Overexpressed histone demethylase in sperm.
    - Histones demethylated, replaced by protamines! (but many more histones
      left in human). Demethylated tails, see number of phenotypes from
      growth to developmental phenotype
    - Epigenetic ineheritance in plnts very common
