* FACS
    - DAPI used as a vital dye like trypan blue, it is pumped out of living
      cells and so stains only dead ones
    - Fucci used to stain for different parts of cell cycle, fluorescence
      fused to cyclin like domain, ubiquitination dependant
    - fcs files generated
    - FSC :: Forward scatter, proportional to size of cells
    - SSC :: Side scatter, proportional to granularity (e.g. when looking at
      granulocytes vs agranulocytes in blood)
** FSC-A vs FSC-H,W
    - Forward scatter area, width, height
    - Have cells passing through cytometer one by one
    - As passes through, measure forward scatter
    - Normal distribution - signal slowly increases then decreases as cell
      passes through
    - Plot on graph and measure area under curve, height of peak and width of
      peak at 1/e
    - If two cells stuck together, we get a doublet on the graph. Double the
      area but measured as single event with same height
    - Hence plotting FSC-A against FSC-H gives us gating for single cells
      only
